  "markdown": "# n8n v1.0 migration guide | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/1-0-migration-checklist.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nThis document provides a summary of what you should be aware of before updating to version 1.0 of n8n.\n\nThe release of n8n 1.0 marks a milestone in n8n's journey to make n8n available for demanding production environments. Version 1.0 represents the hard work invested over the last four years to make n8n the most accessible, powerful, and versatile automation tool. n8n 1.0 is now ready for use in production.\n\n## New features[#](#new-features \"Permanent link\")\n\n### Python support in the Code node[#](#python-support-in-the-code-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nAlthough JavaScript remains the default language, you can now also select Python as an option in the [Code node](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/) and even make use of [many Python modules](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide). Note that Python is unavailable in Code nodes added to a workflow before v1.0.\n\n[PR #4295](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/4295), [PR #6209](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6209)\n\n### Execution order[#](#execution-order \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n 1.0 introduces a new execution order for multi-branch workflows:\n\nIn multi-branch workflows, n8n needs to determine the order in which to execute nodes on branches. Previously, n8n executed the first node of each branch, then the second of each branch, and so on (breadth-first). The new execution order ensures that each branch executes completely before starting the next one (depth-first). Branches execute based on their position on the canvas, from top to bottom. If two branches are at the same height, the leftmost one executes first.\n\nn8n used to execute multi-input nodes as long as they received data on their first input. Nodes connected to the second input of multi-input nodes automatically executed regardless of whether they received data. The new execution order introduced in n8n 1.0 simplifies this behavior: Nodes are now executed only when they receive data, and multi-input nodes require data on at least one of their inputs to execute.\n\nYour existing workflows will use the legacy order, while new workflows will execute using the v1 order. You can configure the execution order for each workflow in [workflow settings](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/).\n\n[PR #4238](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/4238), [PR #6246](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6246), [PR #6507](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6507)\n\n## Deprecations[#](#deprecations \"Permanent link\")\n\n### MySQL and MariaDB[#](#mysql-and-mariadb \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n has removed support for MySQL and MariaDB as storage backends for n8n. These database systems are used by only a few users, yet they require continuous development and maintenance efforts. n8n recommends migrating to PostgreSQL for better compatibility and long-term support.\n\n[PR #6189](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6189)\n\n### EXECUTIONS\\_PROCESS and \"own\" mode[#](#executions_process-and-own-mode \"Permanent link\")\n\nPreviously, you could use the `EXECUTIONS_PROCESS` environment variable to specify whether executions should run in the `main` process or in their `own` processes. This option and `own` mode are now deprecated and will be removed in a future version of n8n. This is because it led to increased code complexity while offering marginal benefits. Starting from n8n 1.0, `main` will be the new default.\n\nNote that executions start much faster in `main` mode than in `own` mode. However, if a workflow consumes more memory than is available, it might crash the entire n8n application instead of just the worker thread. To mitigate this, make sure to allocate enough system resources or configure [queue mode](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/) to distribute executions among multiple workers.\n\n[PR #6196](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6196)\n\n## Breaking changes[#](#breaking-changes \"Permanent link\")\n\n### Docker[#](#docker \"Permanent link\")\n\n#### Permissions change[#](#permissions-change \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen using Docker-based deployments, the n8n process is now run by the user `node` instead of `root`. This change increases security.\n\nIf permission errors appear in your n8n container logs when starting n8n, you may need to update the permissions by executing the following command on the Docker host:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `docker run --rm -it --user root -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n --entrypoint chown n8nio/base:16 -R node:node /home/node/.n8n` |\n\n#### Image removal[#](#image-removal \"Permanent link\")\n\nWe've removed the Debian and RHEL images. If you were using these you need to change the image you use. This shouldn't result in any errors unless you were making a custom image based on one of those images.\n\n#### Entrypoint change[#](#entrypoint-change \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe entrypoint for the container has changed and you no longer need to specify the n8n command. If you were previously running `n8n worker --concurrency=5` it's now `worker --concurrency=5`\n\n[PR #6365](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6365)\n\n### Workflow failures due to expression errors[#](#workflow-failures-due-to-expression-errors \"Permanent link\")\n\nWorkflow executions may fail due to syntax or runtime errors in expressions, such as those that reference non-existent nodes. While expressions already throw errors on the frontend, this change ensures that n8n also throws errors on the backend, where they were previously silently ignored. To receive notifications of failing workflows, n8n recommends setting up an \"error workflow\" under workflow settings.\n\n[PR #6352](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6352)\n\n### Mandatory owner account[#](#mandatory-owner-account \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis change makes [User Management](https://docs.n8n.io/user-management/) mandatory and removes support for other authentication methods, such as BasicAuth and External JWT. Note that the number of permitted users on [n8n.cloud](http://n8n.cloud/) or custom plans still varies depending on your subscription.\n\n[PR #6362](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6362)\n\n### Directory for installing custom nodes[#](#directory-for-installing-custom-nodes \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n will no longer load custom nodes from its global `node_modules` directory. Instead, you must install (or link) them to `~/.n8n/custom` (or a directory defined by `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`). Custom nodes that are npm packages will be located in `~/.n8n/nodes`. If you have custom nodes that were linked using `npm link` into the global `node_modules` directory, you need to link them again, into `~/.n8n/nodes` instead.\n\n[PR #6396](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6396)\n\n### WebSockets[#](#websockets \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe `N8N_PUSH_BACKEND` environment variable can be used to configure one of two available methods for pushing updates to the user interface: `sse` and `websocket`. Starting with n8n 1.0, `websocket` is the default method.\n\n[PR #6196](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6196)\n\n### Date transformation functions[#](#date-transformation-functions \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n provides various transformation functions that operate on dates. These functions may return either a JavaScript `Date` or a Luxon `DateTime` object. With the new behavior, the return type always matches the input. If you call a date transformation function on a `Date`, it returns a `Date`. Similarly, if you call it on a `DateTime` object, it returns a `DateTime` object.\n\nTo identify any workflows and nodes that might be impacted by this change, you can use this [utility workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1929-v1-helper-find-params-with-affected-expressions/).\n\nFor more information about date transformation functions, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/).\n\n[PR #6435](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6435)\n\n### Execution data retention[#](#execution-data-retention \"Permanent link\")\n\nStarting from n8n 1.0, all successful, failed, and manual workflow executions will be saved by default. These settings can be modified for each workflow under \"Workflow Settings,\" or globally using the respective environment variables. Additionally, the `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE` setting will be enabled by default, with `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT` set to 10,000. These default settings are designed to prevent performance degradation when using SQLite. Make sure to configure them according to your individual requirements and system capacity.\n\n[PR #6577](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6577)\n\n### Removed N8N\\_USE\\_DEPRECATED\\_REQUEST\\_LIB[#](#removed-n8n_use_deprecated_request_lib \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe legacy `request` library has been deprecated for some time now. As of n8n 1.0, the ability to fall back to it in the HTTP Request node by setting the `N8N_USE_DEPRECATED_REQUEST_LIB` environment variable has been fully removed. The HTTP Request node will now always use the new `HttpRequest` interface.\n\nIf you build custom nodes, refer to [HTTP request helpers](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/http-helpers/) for more information on migrating to the new interface.\n\n[PR #6413](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/6413)\n\n### Removed WEBHOOK\\_TUNNEL\\_URL[#](#removed-webhook_tunnel_url \"Permanent link\")\n\nAs of version 0.227.0, n8n has renamed the `WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL` configuration option to `WEBHOOK_URL`. In n8n 1.0, `WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL` has been removed. Update your setup to reflect the new name. For more information about this configuration option, refer to [the docs](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/).\n\n[PR #1408](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/pull/1408)\n\n### Remove Node 16 support[#](#remove-node-16-support \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n now requires Node 18.17.0 or above.\n\n## Updating to n8n 1.0[#](#updating-to-n8n-10 \"Permanent link\")\n\n1.  Create a full backup of n8n.\n2.  n8n recommends updating to the latest n8n 0.x release before updating to n8n 1.x. This will allow you to pinpoint any potential issues to the correct release. Once you have verified that n8n 0.x starts up without any issues, proceed to the next step.\n3.  Carefully read the [Deprecations](#deprecations) and [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes) sections above to assess how they may affect your setup.\n4.  Update to n8n 1.0:\n    *   During beta (before July 24th 2023): If using Docker, pull the `next` Docker image.\n    *   After July 24th 2023: If using Docker, pull the `latest` Docker image.\n5.  If you encounter any issues, redeploy the previous n8n version and restore the backup.\n\n## Reporting issues[#](#reporting-issues \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you encounter any issues during the process of updating to n8n 1.0, please seek help in the community [forum](https://community.n8n.io/).\n\n## Thank you[#](#thank-you \"Permanent link\")\n\nWe would like to take a moment to express our gratitude to all of our users for their continued support and feedback. Your contributions are invaluable in helping us make n8n the best possible automation tool. We're excited to continue working with you as we move forward with the release of version 1.0 and beyond. Thank you for being a part of our journey!"

This component is useful for node creators. If your node does insert, update, or upsert operations, you need to send data from the node in a format supported by the service you're integrating with. Often it's necessary to use a Set node before a node that sends data, to get the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node.\n\nRefer to [Node user interface elements | Resource mapper](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/#resource-mapper) for guidance for node builders.\n\n## n8n@0.230.3[#](#n8n02303 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.230.2...n8n@0.230.3) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2023-06-05\n\nThis is a bug fix release.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@0.230.2[#](#n8n02302 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.230.1...n8n@0.230.2) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2023-05-25\n\nThis is a bug fix release.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@0.230.1[#](#n8n02301 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.230.0...n8n@0.230.1) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2023-05-25\n\nThis is a bug fix release.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@0.230.0[#](#n8n02300 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.229.0...n8n@0.230.0) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2023-05-24\n\nThis release contains new features, new nodes, node enhancements, and bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n### New nodes[#](#new-nodes_3 \"Permanent link\")\n\n#### LDAP node[#](#ldap-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe LDAP node allows you to interact with your LDAP servers from your n8n workflows.\n\n[LDAP node documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.ldap/).\n\n### Contributors[#](#contributors_4 \"Permanent link\")\n\n[Bram Kn](https://github.com/bramkn)  \n[pemontto](https://github.com/pemontto)  \n[Yann Aleman](https://github.com/SanYann)\n\n## n8n@0.229.0[#](#n8n02290 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.228.0...n8n@0.229.0) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2023-05-17\n\nThis release contains bug fixes, improves UI copy and error messages in some nodes, and other node enhancements.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n### Node enhancements[#](#node-enhancements \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Google Ads node now supports v13.\n\n## n8n@0.228.2[#](#n8n02282 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.228.1...n8n@0.228.2) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2023-05-15\n\nThis is a bug fix release.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@0.228.1[#](#n8n02281 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.228.0...n8n@0.228.1) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2023-05-11\n\nThis is a bug fix release.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@0.228.0[#](#n8n02280 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.227.0...n8n@0.228.0) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2023-05-11\n\nThis release contains new features, node enhancements, and bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n### New nodes[#](#new-nodes_4 \"Permanent link\")\n\n#### npm node[#](#npm-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis release introduces the [npm](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.npm/) node.

You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md#02140).\n\n### New features[#](#new-features_12 \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   Core: export OpenAPI spec for external tools.\n*   Core: set custom Cache-Control headers for static assets.\n*   Core: simplify pagination in declarative node design.\n*   Editor: support mapping keys with drag and drop. Any field with the hint **Enter the field name as text** should now support mapping a data key using drag and drop. Node builders can enable this in their own nodes. Refer to [Creating nodes | UI elements](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements#support-drag-and-drop-for-data-keys) for more information.\n*   Editor: add the [HTML editor component](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements#html) for use in parameters. This means node builders can now use the HTML editor that n8n uses in the HTML node as a UI component.\n*   Editor: append expressions in fixed values when mapping to string and JSON inputs.\n*   Editor: continue to show mapping tooltip after dismiss.\n*   Editor: roll out schema view.\n\n### Node enhancements[#](#node-enhancements_10 \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   FTP Node: stream binary data for uploads and downloads.\n*   Notion Node: add support for image blocks.\n*   OpenAI Node: add **Frequency Penalty** and **Presence Penalty** to the node options for the text resource.\n*   Salesforce Node: add **Has Opted Out Of Email** field to lead resource options.\n*   SSH Node: stream binary data for uploads and downloads.\n*   Write Binary File Node: stream binary data for writes.\n*   YouTube Node: switch upload operation over to streaming and resumable uploads API.\n\n### Bug fixes[#](#bug-fixes_30 \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   Add paired item to the most used nodes.\n*   Core: fix OAuth2 client credentials not always working.\n*   Core: fix populating of node custom API call options.\n*   Core: fix value resolution in declarative node design.\n*   Core: prevent shared user details being saved alongside execution data.\n*   Core: revert custom API option injecting.\n*   Editor: add SMTP info translation link slot.\n*   Editor: change executions title to match menu.\n*   Editor: fix JSON field completions while typing.\n*   Editor: handling router errors when navigation is canceled by user.\n*   Editor: set max width for executions list.\n*   Editor: stop unsaved changes popup display when navigating away from an untouched workflow.\n*   Editor: fix workflow executions view.\n*   Invoice Ninja Node: fix line items not being correctly set for quotes and invoices.\n*   Linear Node: fix pagination issue for get all issues.\n*   Mailchimp Trigger Node: fix webhook recreation.\n*   Prevent unnecessarily touching `updatedAt` when n8n starts.\n*   Schedule Trigger Node: change scheduler behaviour for intervals days and hours.\n*   Set Node: fix behaviour when selecting `continueOnFail` and `pairedItem`.\n\n## n8n@0.213.0[#](#n8n02130 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.212.1...n8n@0.213.0) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2023-01-27\n\nThis release introduces LDAP, and a new node for working with HTML in n8n.

[commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.186.1...n8n@0.187.0) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2022-07-20\n\nThis release includes several major new features, including:\n\n*   The community nodes repository: a new way to build and share nodes.\n*   Data pinning and data mapping: accelerate workflow development with better data manipulation functionality.\n\n### New features[#](#new-features_41 \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis release introduces the [community node repository](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/). This allows developers to build and share nodes as npm packages. Users can install community-built nodes directly in n8n.\n\n#### Data pinning[#](#data-pinning \"Permanent link\")\n\n[Data pinning](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-pinning/) allows you to freeze and edit data during workflow development. Data pinning means saving the output data of a node, and using the saved data instead of fetching fresh data in future workflow executions. This avoids repeated API calls when developing a workflow, reducing calls to external systems, and speeding up workflow development.\n\n#### Data mapping[#](#data-mapping \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis release introduces a drag and drop interface for [data mapping](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/), as a quick way to map data without using expressions.\n\n#### Simplify authentication setup for node creators[#](#simplify-authentication-setup-for-node-creators \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis release introduces a simpler way of handling authorization when building a node. All credentials should now contain an `authenticate` property that dictates how the credential is used in a request. n8n has also simplified authentication types: instead of specifying an authentication type and using the correct interface, you can now set the type as `\"generic\"`, and use the `IAuthenticateGeneric` interface.\n\nYou can use this approach for any authentication method where data is sent in the header, body, or query string. This includes methods like bearer and basic auth. You can't use this approach for more complex authentication types that require multiple calls, or for methods that don't pass authentication data. This includes OAuth.\n\nFor an example of the new authentication syntax, refer to n8n's [Asana node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/credentials/AsanaApi.credentials.ts).\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n\n`// in AsanaApi.credentials.ts import { \tIAuthenticateGeneric, \tICredentialType, \tINodeProperties, } from 'n8n-workflow';  export class AsanaApi implements ICredentialType { \tname = 'asanaApi'; \tdisplayName = 'Asana API'; \tdocumentationUrl = 'asana'; \tproperties: INodeProperties[] = [ \t\t{ \t\t\tdisplayName: 'Access Token', \t\t\tname: 'accessToken', \t\t\ttype: 'string', \t\t\tdefault: '', \t\t}, \t];  \tauthenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = { \t\ttype: 'generic', \t\tproperties: { \t\t\theaders: { \t\t\t\tAuthorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.accessToken}}', \t\t\t}, \t\t}, \t}; }`\n\n#### Other new features[#](#other-new-features_1 \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   Added a `preAuthentication` method to credentials.\n*   Added more credentials tests.\n*   Introduce automatic fixing for paired item information in some scenarios.\n\n### Node enhancements[#](#node-enhancements_31 \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   [ERPNext node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.erpnext/): add credential tests, and add support for unauthorized certs.\n*   [Google Drive node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googledrive/): add support for move to trash.\n*   [Mindee node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mindee/): support new version.\n*   [Notion node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notion/): support ignoring the Notion URL property if empty.\n*   [Shopify node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.shopify/): add OAuth support.\n\n### Bug fixes[#](#bug-fixes_76 \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   API: add missing node settings parameters.\n*   API: validate static data value for resource workflow.\n*   Baserow Node: fix an issue preventing table names from loading.\n*   Editor: hide the **Execute previous node** button when in read-only mode.\n*   Editor: hide tabs if there's only one branch.\n*   Roundup of link fixes in nodes.\n\n### Contributors[#](#contributors_34 \"Permanent link\")\n\n[Florian Bachmann](https://github.com/baflo) [Olivier Aygalenq](https://github.com/oaygalenq)\n\n## n8n@0.186.1[#](#n8n01861 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.186.0...n8n@0.186.1) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2022-07-14\n\nThis is a bug fix release.

However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the HTTP Request node.\n\nOne of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication. To simplify this, n8n now provides a way to use existential credential types (credentials associated with n8n nodes) in the HTTP Request node.\n\nFor more information, refer to [Custom API

adds support for node versioning, along with node enhancements and bug fixes.\n\n### New features[#](#new-features_50 \"Permanent link\")\n\n#### Node versioning[#](#node-versioning \"Permanent link\")\n\n0.175.0 adds support for a lightweight method of node versioning. One node can contain multiple versions, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature, change the `version` parameter in your node to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version. You can then access the version parameter with `@version` in your `displayOptions` (to control which version n8n displays). You can also query the version in your `execute` function using `const nodeVersion = this.getNode().typeVersion;`.\n\n### Node enhancements[#](#node-enhancements_42 \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   [Google Sheets node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/): n8n now handles header names formatted as JSON paths.\n*   [Microsoft Dynamics CRM node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftdynamicscrm/): add support for regions other than North America.\n*   [Telegram node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/): add support for querying chat administrators.\n\n### Bug fixes[#](#bug-fixes_89 \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **core**: fixed an issue that was causing n8n to apply authentication checks, even when user management was disabled.\n*   **core**: n8n now skips credentials checks for disabled nodes.\n*   **editor**: fix a bug affecting touchscreen monitors.\n*   [HubSpot node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.hubspot/): fix for search operators.\n*   [SendGrid node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sendgrid/): fixed an issue with sending attachments.\n*   [Wise node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wise/): respect the time parameter on `get: exchangeRate`.\n\n### Contributors[#](#contributors_43 \"Permanent link\")\n\n[Jack Rudenko](https://github.com/erudenko) [MC Naveen](https://github.com/mcnaveen) [vcrwr](https://github.com/vcrwr)\n\n## n8n@0.174.0[#](#n8n01740 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@0.173.1...n8n@0.174.0) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2022-04-25\n\n### New features[#](#new-features_51 \"Permanent link\")\n\n#### Sticky Notes[#](#sticky-notes \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis release adds Sticky Notes, a new feature that allows you to annotate and comment on your workflows.

They're an entry point for retrieving data, a function to process data, or an exit for sending data. The data process includes filtering, recomposing, and changing data. There can be one or several nodes for your API, service or app. You can connect multiple nodes, which allows you to create complex workflows.\n\n## Built-in nodes[#](#built-in-nodes \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n includes a collection of built-in integrations. Refer to [Built-in nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/node-types/) for documentation on all n8n's built-in nodes.\n\nAs well as using the built-in nodes, you can also install community-built nodes. Refer to [Community nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) for more information.\n\n## Credential-only nodes and custom operations[#](#credential-only-nodes-and-custom-operations \"Permanent link\")\n\nOne of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication. n8n provides credentials support for operations and services beyond those supported by built-in nodes.\n\n*   Custom operations for existing nodes: n8n supplies hundreds of nodes to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node.\n*   Credential-only nodes: n8n includes credential-only nodes. These are integrations where n8n supports setting up credentials for use in the HTTP Request node, but doesn't provide a standalone node. You can find a credential-only node in the nodes panel, as you would for any other integration.\n\nRefer to [Custom operations](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/custom-operations/) for more information.\n\n## Generic integrations[#](#generic-integrations \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you need to connect to a service where n8n doesn't have a node, or a credential-only node, you can still use the [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node. Refer to the node page for details on how to set up authentication and create your API call.\n\n## Where to go next[#](#where-to-go-next \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   If you want to create your own node, head over to the [Creating Nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/overview/) section.\n*   Check out [Community nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes) to learn about installing and managing community-built nodes.\n*   If you'd like to learn more about the different nodes in n8n, their functionalities and example usage, check out n8n's node libraries: [Core nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/), [Actions](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/), and [Triggers](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/).\n*   If you'd like to learn how to add the credentials for the different nodes, head over to the [Credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/) section."

It's useful when developing a workflow. By mocking data, you can:\n\n*   Avoid making repeated calls to your data source. This saves time and costs.\n*   Work with a small, predictable dataset during initial development.\n*   Avoid the risk of overwriting live data: in the early stages of building your workflow, you don't need to connect your real data source.\n\n## Mocking with real data using data pinning[#](#mocking-with-real-data-using-data-pinning \"Permanent link\")\n\nUsing [data pinning](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-pinning/), you load real data into your workflow, then pin it in the output panel of a node. Using this approach you have realistic data, with only one call to your data source. You can [edit pinned data](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-editing/).\n\nUse this approach when you need to configure your workflow to handle the exact data structure and parameters provided by your data source.\n\nTo pin data in a node:\n\n1.  Run the node to load data.\n2.  In the **OUTPUT** view, select **Pin data** ![Pin data icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/data/data-pinning/data-pinning-button.png).

By default, all newly created workflows are deactivated.\n\nTo activate your workflow, set the **Inactive** toggle in the top navigation of the Editor UI to be **Activated**. Nathan's workflow will now be executed automatically every Monday at 9 AM:\n\n![Activated workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-8-activated-workflow.png)\n\n_Activated workflow_\n\n## Workflow Executions[#](#workflow-executions \"Permanent link\")\n\nAn execution represents a completed run of a workflow, from the first to the last node. n8n logs workflow executions, allowing you to see if the workflow was completed successfully or not. The execution log is useful for debugging your workflow and seeing at what stage it runs into issues.\n\nTo see the execution log, in your Editor UI select **All executions** in the left panel. This will open the **Executions** window.\n\n![Execution List](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-8-execution-list.png)\n\n_Execution List_\n\nThe **Executions** window displays a table with the following information:\n\n*   **Name**: The name of the workflow\n*   **Started At**: The date and time when the workflow started\n*   **Status**: The status of the workflow (Waiting, Running, Succeeded, Cancelled, or Failed) and the amount of time it took the workflow to execute\n*   **Execution ID**: The ID of this workflow execution\n\nWorkflow execution status\n\nYou can filter the displayed **Executions** by workflow and by status (**Any Status**, **Failed**, **Cancelled**, **Running**, **Success**, or **Waiting**). The information displayed here depends on which executions are configured to be saved in the [**Workflow Settings**](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/).\n\n## Workflow Settings[#](#workflow-settings \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can customize your workflows and executions, or overwrite some of the global default settings in [**Workflow Settings**](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/).\n\nAccess these settings by selecting the three dots in the upper right corner of the Editor UI, then select **Settings**.\n\n![Workflow Settings](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-8-workflow-settings.png)\n\n_Workflow Settings_\n\nIn the **Workflow Settings** window you can configure the following settings:\n\n*   [**Error Workflow**](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/error-handling/): A workflow to run in case the execution of the current workflow fails.\n*   **This workflow can be called by**: Workflows that are allowed to call this workflow using the [Execute Workflow node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/).\n*   **Timezone**: The timezone to use in the current workflow. If not set, the global timezone (by default \"New York\") is used. This setting is particularly important for the [Schedule Trigger node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/), as you want to make sure that the workflow gets executed at the right time.\n*   **Save failed production executions**: If the Execution data of the workflow should be saved when it fails. Default is to save.\n*   **Save successful production executions**: If the Execution data of the workflow should be saved when it succeeds. Default is to save.\n*   **Save manual executions**: If executions started from the Editor UI should be saved. Default is to save.\n*   **Save execution progress**: If the execution data of each node should be saved. If set to Save, you can resume the workflow from where it stopped in case of an error, though keep in mind that this might make the execution slower. Default is not to save.\n*   **Timeout Workflow**: Whether to cancel a workflow execution after a specific period of time. Default is not to timeout.\n\n## What's next?[#](#whats-next \"Permanent link\")\n\n**You 👩‍🔧**: That was it! Now you have a 7-node workflow that will run automatically every Monday morning. You don't have to worry about remembering to wrangle the data. Instead, you can start your week with more meaningful or exciting work.\n\n**Nathan 🙋**: This workflow is incredibly helpful, thank you! Now, what's next for you?\n\n**You 👩‍🔧**: I'd like to build more workflows, share them with others, and use some workflows built by other people."

The creator is the user who created the workflow. Editors are other users with access to the workflow.\n\nYou can't change the workflow owner, except when deleting the user.\n\nCredentials\n\nWorkflow sharing allows editors to use all credentials used in the workflow. This includes credentials that aren't explicitly shared with them using [credential sharing](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/credential-sharing/).\n\n### Permissions[#](#permissions \"Permanent link\")\n\nSharing in n8n works on the principle of least privilege. This means that if a user shares a workflow with you, but they don't share their credentials, you can't edit the nodes within the workflow that use those credentials. You can view and run the workflow, and edit nodes that don't use unshared credentials.\n\nRefer to [Credential sharing](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/credential-sharing/) for guidance on sharing credentials."

This section introduces n8n's REST API, including:\n\n*   How to [authenticate](https://docs.n8n.io/api/authentication/)\n*   [Paginating](https://docs.n8n.io/api/pagination/) results\n*   Using the [built-in API playground](https://docs.n8n.io/api/using-api-playground/) (self-hosted n8n only)\n*   [Endpoint reference](https://docs.n8n.io/api/api-reference/)\n\nn8n provides an [n8n API node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.n8n/) to access the API in your workflows.\n\n## Learn about REST APIs[#](#learn-about-rest-apis \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe API documentation assumes you are familiar with REST APIs. If you're not, these resources may be helpful:\n\n*   [KnowledgeOwl's guide to working with APIs](https://support.knowledgeowl.com/help/working-with-apis): a basic introduction, including examples of how to call REST APIs.\n*   [IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is an Application Programming Interface (API)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/api): this gives a general, but technical, introduction to APIs.\n*   [IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is a REST API?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/rest-apis): more detailed information about REST APIs.\n*   [MDN web docs - An overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview): REST APIs work over HTTP and use HTTP verbs, or methods, to specify the action to perform.\n\nUse the API playground (self-hosted n8n only)\n\nTrying out the API in the [playground](https://docs.n8n.io/api/using-api-playground/) can help you understand how APIs work. If you're worried about changing live data, consider setting up a test workflow, or test n8n instance, to explore safely."

You can achieve this using different nodes depending on your workflow requirements.\n\n*   Merge data from different data streams or nodes: Use the [Merge](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) node to combine data from various sources into one.\n*   Merge data from multiple node executions: Use the [Code](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node for complex scenarios where you need to merge data from multiple executions of a node or multiple nodes.\n*   Compare and merge data: Use the [Compare Datasets](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.comparedatasets/) node to compare, merge, and output data streams based on the comparison.\n\nExplore each method in more detail in the sections below.\n\n## Merge data from different data streams[#](#merge-data-from-different-data-streams \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf your workflow [splits](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/splitting/), you combine the separate streams back into one stream.\n\nHere's an [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1747-joining-different-datasets/) showing different types of merging: appending data sets, keeping only new items, and keeping only existing items.

  "markdown": "# Looping | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/flow-logic/looping.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nLooping is useful when you want to process multiple items or perform an action repeatedly, such as sending a message to every contact in your address book. n8n handles this repetitive processing automatically, meaning you don't need to specifically build loops into your workflows. There are [some nodes](#node-exceptions) where this isn't true.\n\n## Using loops in n8n[#](#using-loops-in-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n nodes take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can think of each item as a single data point, or a single row in the output table of a node.\n\n![The Customer Datastore node output](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/flow-logic/looping/customer_datastore_node.png)\n\nNodes usually run once for each item. For example, if you wanted to send the name and notes of the customers in the Customer Datastore node as a message on Slack, you would:\n\n1.  Connect the Slack node to the Customer Datastore node.\n2.  Configure the parameters.\n3.  Execute the node.\n\nYou would receive five messages: one for each item.\n\nThis is how you can process multiple items without having to explicitly connect nodes in a loop.\n\n### Executing nodes once[#](#executing-nodes-once \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor situations where you don't want a node to process all received items, for example sending a Slack message only to the first customer, you can do so by toggling the **Execute Once** parameter in the **Settings** tab of that node This setting is helpful when the incoming data contains multiple items and you want to only process the first one.\n\n## Creating loops[#](#creating-loops \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n typically handles the iteration for all incoming items. However, there are certain scenarios where you will have to create a loop to iterate through all items. Refer to [Node exceptions](#node-exceptions) for a list of nodes that don't automatically iterate over all incoming items.\n\n### Loop until a condition is met[#](#loop-until-a-condition-is-met \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo create a loop in an n8n workflow, connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node. Add an [IF](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) node to check when to stop the loop.\n\nHere is an [example workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1130) that implements a loop with an `IF` node:\n\n![Editor UI view of sample workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/flow-logic/looping/example_workflow.png)\n\n### Loop until all items are processed[#](#loop-until-all-items-are-processed \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse the [Loop Over Items](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node when you want to loop until all items are processed. To process each item individually, set **Batch Size** to `1`.\n\nYou can batch the data in groups and process these batches. This approach is useful for avoiding API rate limits when processing large incoming data or when you want to process a specific group of returned items.\n\nThe Loop Over Items node stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow so it's not necessary to add an IF node to stop the loop.\n\n## Node exceptions[#](#node-exceptions \"Permanent link\")\n\nNodes and operations where you need to design a loop into your workflow:\n\n*   [CrateDB](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.cratedb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.\n*   [Code](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node in **Run Once for All Items** mode: processes all the items based on the entered code snippet.\n*   [Execute Workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node in **Run Once for All Items** mode.\n*   [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/): you must handle pagination yourself. If your API call returns paginated results you must create a loop to fetch one page at a time.\n*   [Microsoft SQL](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftsql/) executes once for `insert`, `update`, and `delete`.\n*   [MongoDB](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mongodb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`.\n*   [QuestDB](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.questdb/) executes once for `insert`.\n*   [Redis](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.redis/):\n    *   Info: this operation executes only once, regardless of the number of items in the incoming data.\n*   [TimescaleDB](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.timescaledb/) executes once for `insert` and `update`."

  "markdown": "# Understanding the data structure | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/courses/level-two/chapter-1.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about the data structure of n8n and how to use the [Code node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) to transform data and simulate node outputs.\n\n## Data structure of n8n[#](#data-structure-of-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn a basic sense, n8n nodes function as an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool. The nodes allow you to access (extract) data from multiple disparate sources, modify (transform) that data in a particular way, and pass (load) it along to where it needs to be.\n\nThe data that moves along from node to node in your workflow must be in a format (structure) that can be recognized and interpreted by each node. In n8n, this required structure is an array of objects.\n\nAbout array of objects\n\nAn array is a list of values. The array can be empty or contain several elements. Each element is stored at a position (index) in the list, starting at 0, and can be referenced by the index number. For example, in the array `[\"Leonardo\", \"Michelangelo\", \"Donatello\", \"Raphael\"];` the element `Donatello` is stored at index 2.\n\nAn object stores key-value pairs, instead of values at numbered indexes as in arrays. The order of the pairs isn't important, as the values can be accessed by referencing the key name. For example, the object below contains two properties (`name` and `color`):\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{ \tname: 'Michelangelo', \tcolor: 'blue', }` |\n\nAn array of objects is an array that contains one or more objects. For example, the array `turtles` below contains four objects:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18 | `var turtles = [ \t{ \t\tname: 'Michelangelo', \t\tcolor: 'orange', \t}, \t{ \t\tname: 'Donatello', \t\tcolor: 'purple', \t}, \t{ \t\tname: 'Raphael', \t\tcolor: 'red', \t}, \t{ \t\tname: 'Leonardo', \t\tcolor: 'blue', \t} ];` |\n\nYou can access the properties of an object using dot notation with the syntax `object.property`. For example, `turtles[1].color` gets the color of the second turtle.\n\nData sent from one node to another is sent as an array of JSON objects. The elements in this collection are called items.\n\n![](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/explanation_items.png)\n\n_Items_\n\nAn n8n node performs its action on each item of incoming data.\n\n![](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/flow-logic/looping/customer_datastore_node.png)\n\n_Items in the Customer Datastore node_\n\n## Creating data sets with the Code node[#](#creating-data-sets-with-the-code-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nNow that you are familiar with the n8n data structure, you can use it to create your own data sets or simulate node outputs. To do this, use the [Code node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) to write JavaScript code defining your array of objects with the following structure:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `return [ \t{ \t\tjson: { \t\t\tapple: 'beets', \t\t} \t} ];` |\n\nFor example, the array of objects representing the Ninja turtles would look like this in the Code node:\n\n![](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/exercise_function_notnested.png)\n\n_Array of objects in the Code node_\n\nJSON objects\n\nNotice that this array of objects contains an extra key: `json`. n8n expects you to wrap each object in an array in another object, with the key `json`.\n\n![](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/explanation_datastructure.png)\n\n_Illustration of data structure in n8n_\n\nIt's good practice to pass the data in the right structure used by n8n. But don't worry if you forget to add the `json` key to an item, n8n (version 0.166.0 and above) adds it automatically.\n\nYou can also have nested pairs, for example if you want to define a primary and a secondary color. In this case, you need to further wrap the key-value pairs in curly braces `{}`.\n\nn8n data structure video\n\n[This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQHT3Unn4tY) offers a more detailed explanation of data structure in n8n.\n\n### Exercise[#](#exercise \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn a Code node, create an array of objects named `myContacts` that contains the properties `name` and `email`, and the `email` property is further split into `personal` and `work`.\n\nShow me the solution\n\nIn the **Code node**, in the JavaScript Code field you have to write the following code:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22 | `var myContacts = [ \t{ \t\tjson: { \t\t\tname: 'Alice', \t\t\temail: { \t\t\t\tpersonal: 'alice@home.com', \t\t\t\twork: 'alice@wonderland.org' \t\t\t}, \t\t} \t}, \t{ \t\tjson: { \t\t\tname: 'Bob', \t\t\temail: { \t\t\t\tpersonal: 'bob@mail.com', \t\t\t\twork: 'contact@thebuilder.com' \t\t\t\t}, \t\t} \t}, ];  return myContacts;` |\n\nWhen you execute the **Code node**, the result should look like this:\n\n![](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/exercise_function.png)\n\n_Result of Code node_\n\n## Referencing node data with the Code node[#](#referencing-node-data-with-the-code-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nJust like you can use [expressions](https://docs.n8n.io/code/expressions/) to reference data from other nodes, you can also use some [methods and variables](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/overview/) in the **Code node**.\n\nPlease make sure you read these pages before continuing to the next exercise.\n\n### Exercise[#](#exercise_1 \"Permanent link\")\n\nLet's build on the previous exercise, in which you used the Code node to create a data set of two contacts with their names and emails. Now, connect a second Code node to the first one. In the new node, write code to create a new column named `workEmail` that references the work email of the first contact.\n\nShow me the solution\n\nIn the **Code node**, in the JavaScript Code field you have to write the following code:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `let items = $input.all(); items[0].json.workEmail = items[0].json.email['work']; return items;` |\n\nWhen you execute the **Code node**, the result should look like this:\n\n![](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-one/exercise_function_reference.png)\n\n_Code node reference_\n\n## Transforming data[#](#transforming-data \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe incoming data from some nodes may have a different data structure than the one used in n8n. In this case, you need to [transform the data](https://docs.n8n.io/data/transforming-data/), so that each item can be processed individually.\n\nThe two most common operations for data transformation are:\n\n*   Creating multiple items from one item\n*   Creating a single item from multiple items\n\nThere are several ways to transform data for the purposes mentioned above:\n\n*   Use n8n's [data transformation nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/data/#data-transformation-nodes). Use these nodes to modify the structure of incoming data that contain lists (arrays) without needing to use JavaScript code in the **Code node**:\n    *   Use the [**Split Out node**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/) to separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.\n    *   Use the [**Aggregate node**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/) to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.\n*   Use the **Code node** to write JavaScript functions to modify the data structure of incoming data using the **Run Once for All Items** mode:\n    *   To create multiple items from a single item, you can use JavaScript code like this. This example assumes that the item has a key named `data` set to an array of items in the form of: `[{ \"data\": [{<item_1>}, {<item_2>}, ...] }]`:\n        \n        |     |     |\n        | --- | --- |\n        |     | `return $input.first().json.data.map(item => {     return {         json: item     } });` |\n        \n    *   To create a single item from multiple items, you can use this JavaScript code:\n        \n        |     |     |\n        | --- | --- |\n        |     | `return [ \t{     \tjson: {     \t\tdata_object: $input.all().map(item => item.json)     \t}     }   ];` |\n        \n\nThese JavaScript examples assume your entire input is what you want to transform. As in the exercise above, you can also execute either operation on a specific field by identifying that in the items list, for example, if our workEmail example had multiple emails in a single field, we could run some code like this:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `let items = $input.all(); return items[0].json.workEmail.map(item => { \treturn { \t\tjson: item \t} });` |\n\n### Exercise[#](#exercise_2 \"Permanent link\")\n\n1.  Use the **HTTP Request node** to make a GET request to the Quotable API `https://api.quotable.io/quotes`. (This API requires no authentication).\n2.  Transform the data in the `results` field with the **Split Out node**.\n3.  Transform the data in the `results` field with the **Code node**.\n\nShow me the solution\n\n1.  To get the quotes from the Quotable API, execute the **HTTP Request node** with the following parameters:\n    *   **Authentication**: None\n    *   **Request Method**: GET\n    *   **URL**: https://api.quotable.io/quotes\n2.  To transform the data with the **Split Out node**, connect this node to the **HTTP Request node** and set the following parameters:\n    *   **Field To Split Out**: results\n    *   **Include**: No Other Fields\n3.  To transform the data with the **Code node**, connect this node to the **HTTP Request node** and write the following code in the JavaScript Code field:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `let items = $input.all(); return items[0].json.results.map(item => { \treturn { \t\tjson: item \t} });` |"

  "markdown": "# Processing different data types | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/courses/level-two/chapter-2.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn how to process different types of data using [n8n core nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/).\n\n## HTML and XML data[#](#html-and-xml-data \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou're most likely familiar with HTML and XML.\n\nHTML vs. XML\n\nHTML is a markup language used to describe the structure and semantics of a web page. XML looks similar to HTML, but the tag names are different, as they describe the kind of data they hold.\n\nIf you need to process HTML or XML data in your n8n workflows, use the [**HTML node**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.html/) or the [**XML node**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.xml/).\n\nUse the **HTML node** to extract HTML content of a webpage by referencing CSS selectors. This is useful if you want to collect structured information from a website (web-scraping).\n\n### HTML Exercise[#](#html-exercise \"Permanent link\")\n\nLet's get the title of the latest n8n blog post:\n\n1.  Use the **HTTP Request node** to make a GET request to the URL `https://blog.n8n.io/` (this endpoint requires no authentication).\n2.  Connect an **HTML node** and configure it to extract the title of the first blog post on the page.\n    *   Hint: If you're not familiar with CSS selectors or reading HTML, the CSS selector `.item-title a` should help!\n\nShow me the solution\n\n1.  Configure the HTTP Request node with the following parameters:\n    *   **Authentication**: None\n    *   **Request Method**: GET\n    *   **URL**: https://blog.n8n.io/ The result should look like this:\n\n![Result of HTTP Request node](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-two/exercise_html_httprequestnode.png)\n\n_Result of HTTP Request node_\n\n2.  Connect an **HTML node** to the **HTTP Request node** and configure the former's parameters:\n    *   **Operation**: Extract HTML Content\n    *   **Source Data**: JSON\n    *   **JSON Property**: data\n    *   **Extraction Values**:\n        *   **Key**: title\n        *   **CSS Selector**: `.item-title a`\n        *   **Return Value**: HTML\n\nYou can add more values to extract more data.\n\nThe result should look like this:\n\n![Result of HTML Extract node](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-two/exercise_html_htmlextractnode.png)\n\n_Result of HTML Extract node_\n\nUse the **XML node** to convert XML to JSON and JSON to XML. This operation is useful if you work with different web services that use either XML or JSON and need to get and submit data between them in the two formats.\n\n### XML Exercise[#](#xml-exercise \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn the [final exercise of Chapter 1](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-two/chapter-1/#exercise_2), you used an **HTTP Request node** to make a request to the Quotable API. In this exercise, we'll return to that same API but we'll convert the output to XML:\n\n1.  Add an **HTTP Request node** that makes the same request to the Quotable API at `https://api.quotable.io/quotes`.\n2.  Use the XML node to convert the JSON output to XML.\n\nShow me the solution\n\n1.  To get the quotes from the Quotable API, execute the **HTTP Request node** with the following parameters:\n    *   **Authentication**: None\n    *   **Request Method**: GET\n    *   **URL**: https://api.quotable.io/quotes\n2.  Connect an **XML node** to it with the following parameters:\n    *   **Mode**: JSON to XML\n    *   **Property name**: data\n\nThe result should look like this:\n\n![Table view of XML Node (JSON to XML)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-two/exercise_html_xmlnode_table.png)\n\n_XML node (JSON to XML) – Table View_\n\nTo transform data the other way around, select the mode **XML to JSON**.\n\n## Date, time, and interval data[#](#date-time-and-interval-data \"Permanent link\")\n\nDate and time data types include `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, and `YEAR`. The dates and times can be passed in different formats, for example:\n\n*   `DATE`: March 29 2022, 29-03-2022, 2022/03/29\n*   `TIME`: 08:30:00, 8:30, 20:30\n*   `DATETIME`: 2022/03/29 08:30:00\n*   `TIMESTAMP`: 1616108400 (Unix timestamp), 1616108400000 (Unix ms timestamp)\n*   `YEAR`: 2022, 22\n\nThere are a few ways you can work with dates and times:\n\n*   Use the [**Date & Time node**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime/) to convert date and time data to different formats and calculate dates.\n*   Use [**Schedule Trigger node**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/) to schedule workflows to run at a specific time, interval, or duration.\n\nSometimes, you might need to pause the workflow execution. This might be necessary if you know that a service doesn't process the data instantly or it's slow to return all the results. In these cases, you don't want n8n to pass incomplete data to the next node.\n\nIf you run into situations like this, use the [**Wait node**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) after the node that you want to delay. The **Wait node** pauses the workflow execution and will resume execution:\n\n*   At a specific time.\n*   After a specified time interval.\n*   On a webhook call.\n\n### Date Exercise[#](#date-exercise \"Permanent link\")\n\nBuild a workflow that adds five days to an input date from the Customer Datastore node that you used before. Then, if the calculated date occurred after 1959, the workflow waits 1 minute before [setting](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) the calculated date as a value. The workflow should be triggered every 30 minutes.\n\nTo begin:\n\n1.  Add the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** with the **Get All People** action selected. Return All.\n2.  Add the **Date & Time node** to Round Up the created Date from the datastore to End of Month. Output this to field new-date. Include all input fields.\n3.  Add the **If node** to check if that new rounded date is after `1960-01-01 00:00:00`.\n4.  Add the **Wait node** to the True output of that node and set it to wait for one minute.\n5.  Add the **Edit Fields (Set) node** to set a new field called outputValue to a String containing new-date. Include all input fields.\n6.  Add the **Schedule Trigger node** at the beginning of the workflow to trigger it every 30 minutes. (You can keep the [Manual Trigger node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.manualworkflowtrigger/) for testing!)\n\nShow me the solution\n\n1.  Add the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** with the **Get All People** action selected.\n    *   Select the option to **Return All**.\n2.  Add a **Date & Time node** connected to the Customer Datastore node. Select the option to **Round a Date**.\n    *   Add the `created` date as the **Date** to round.\n    *   Select `Round Up` as the **Mode** and `End of Month` as the **To**.\n    *   Set the **Output Field Name** as `new-date`.\n    *   In **Options**, select **Add Option** and use the control to **Include Input Fields**\n3.  Add an **If node** connected to the **Date & Time node**.\n    *   Add the new-date field as the first part of the condition.\n    *   Set the comparison to **Date &Time > is after**\n    *   Add `1960-01-01 00:00:00` as the second part of the expression. (This should produce 3 items in the True Branch and 2 items in the False Branch)\n4.  Add a **Wait node** to the True output of the **If node**.\n    *   Set **Resume** to `After Time interval`.\n    *   Set **Wait Amount** to `1.00`.\n    *   Set **Wait Unit** to `Minutes`.\n5.  Add an **Edit Fields (Set) node** to the **Wait node**.\n    *   Use either JSON or Manual Mapping **Mode**.\n    *   Set a new field called `outputValue` to be the value of the new-date field.\n    *   Select the option to **Include Other Input Fields** and include **All** fields.\n6.  Add a **Schedule Trigger node** at the beginning of the workflow.\n    *   Set the **Trigger Interval** to use `Minutes`.\n    *   Set the **Minutes Between Triggers** to 30.\n    *   To test your schedule, be sure to activate the workflow.\n    *   Be sure to connect this node to the **Customer Datastore (n8n training) node** you began with!\n\nThe workflow should look like this:\n\n![Workflow for transforming dates](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-two/exercise_datetime.png)\n\n_Workflow for transforming dates_\n\nTo check the configuration of each node, you can copy the JSON code of this workflow and either paste it into the Editor UI or save it as a file and import from file into a new workflow.

Binary data[#](#binary-data \"Permanent link\")\n\nUp to now, you have mainly worked with text data. But what if you want to process data that's not text, like images or PDF files? These types of files are represented in the binary numeral system, so they're considered binary data. In this form, binary data doesn't offer you useful information, so you'll need to convert it into a readable form.\n\nIn n8n, you can process binary data with the following nodes:\n\n*   [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to request and send files from/to web resources and APIs.\n*   [Read/Write Files from Disk](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) to read and write files from/to the machine where n8n is running.\n*   [Convert to File](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) to take input data and output it as a file.\n*   [Extract From File](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/) to get data from a binary format and convert it to JSON.\n\nReading and writing files is only available on self-hosted n8n\n\nReading and writing files to disk isn't available on n8n Cloud. You'll read and write to the machine where you installed n8n. If you run n8n in Docker, your command runs in the n8n container and not the Docker host. The Read/Write Files From Disk node looks for files relative to the n8n install path. n8n recommends using absolute file paths to prevent any errors.\n\nTo read or write a binary file, you need to write the path (location) of the file in the node's `File(s) Selector` parameter (for the Read operation) or in the node's `File Path and Name` parameter (for the Write operation).\n\nNaming the right path\n\nThe file path looks slightly different depending on how you are running n8n:\n\n*   npm: `~/my_file.json`\n*   n8n cloud / Docker: `/tmp/my_file.json`\n\n### Binary Exercise 1[#](#binary-exercise-1 \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor our first binary exercise, let's convert a PDF file to JSON:\n\n1.  Make an HTTP request to get this PDF file: `https://media.kaspersky.com/pdf/Kaspersky_Lab_Whitepaper_Anti_blocker.pdf.`\n2.

  "markdown": "# Merging and splitting data | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/courses/level-two/chapter-3.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn how to merge and split data, and in what cases it might be useful to perform these operations.\n\n## Merging data[#](#merging-data \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn some cases, you might need to merge (combine) and process data from different sources.\n\nMerging data can involve:\n\n*   Creating one data set from multiple sources.\n*   Synchronizing data between multiple systems. This could include removing duplicate data or updating data in one system when it changes in another.\n\nOne-way vs. two-way sync\n\nIn a one-way sync, data is synchronized in one direction. One system serves as the single source of truth. When information changes in that main system, it automatically changes in the secondary system; but if information changes in the secondary system, the changes aren't reflected in the main system.\n\nIn a two-way sync, data is synchronized in both directions (between both systems). When information changes in either of the two systems, it automatically changes in the other one as well.\n\n[This blog tutorial](https://n8n.io/blog/how-to-sync-data-between-two-systems/) explains how to sync data one-way and two-way between two CRMs.\n\nIn n8n, you can merge data from two different nodes using the [Merge node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/), which provides several merging options:\n\n*   [Append](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#append)\n*   [Combine](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#combine)\n    *   [Merge by Fields](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#merge-by-fields): requires input fields to match on\n    *   [Merge by Position](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#merge-by-position)\n    *   [Multiplex](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#multiplex)\n*   [Choose Branch](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/#choose-branch)\n\nNotice that Combine > Merge by Fields requires you enter input fields to match on. These fields should contain identical values between the data sources so n8n can properly match data together. In the **Merge node**, they're called `Input 1 Field` and `Input 2 Field`.\n\n![Property Input fields in the Merge node](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-three/explanation_mergepropertyinput.png)\n\n_Property Input fields in the Merge node_\n\nProperty Input in dot notation\n\nIf you want to reference nested values in the **Merge node** parameters `Input 1 Field` and `Input 2 Field`, you need to enter the property key in dot-notation format (as text, not as an expression).\n\nNote\n\nYou can also find the **Merge node** under the alias Join. This might be more intuitive if you're familiar with SQL joins.\n\n### Merge Exercise[#](#merge-exercise \"Permanent link\")\n\nBuild a workflow that merges data from the Customer Datastore node and Code node.\n\n1.  Add a **Merge node** that takes `Input 1` from a **Customer Datastore node** and `Input 2` from a **Code node**.\n2.  In the **Customer Datastore node**, run the operation **Get All People**.\n3.  In the **Code node**, create an array of two objects with three properties: `name`, `language`, and `country`, where the property `country` has two sub-properties `code` and `name`.\n    *   Fill out the values of these properties with the information of two characters from the Customer Database.\n    *   For example, Jay Gatsby's language is English and country name is United States.\n4.  In the **Merge node**, try out different merge options.\n\nShow me the solution\n\nThe workflow for this exercise looks like this:\n\n![Workflow exercise for merging data](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-three/exercise_merge.png)\n\n_Workflow exercise for merging data_\n\nIf you merge data with the option **Keep Matches** using the name as the input fields to match, the result should look like this (note this example only contains Jay Gatsby; yours might look different depending on which characters you selected):\n\n![Output of Merge node with option to keep matches](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-three/exercise_merge_kkm.png)\n\n_Output of Merge node with option to keep matches_\n\nTo check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br>  2<br>  3<br>  4<br>  5<br>  6<br>  7<br>  8<br>  9<br> 10<br> 11<br> 12<br> 13<br> 14<br> 15<br> 16<br> 17<br> 18<br> 19<br> 20<br> 21<br> 22<br> 23<br> 24<br> 25<br> 26<br> 27<br> 28<br> 29<br> 30<br> 31<br> 32<br> 33<br> 34<br> 35<br> 36<br> 37<br> 38<br> 39<br> 40<br> 41<br> 42<br> 43<br> 44<br> 45<br> 46<br> 47<br> 48<br> 49<br> 50<br> 51<br> 52<br> 53<br> 54<br> 55<br> 56<br> 57<br> 58<br> 59<br> 60<br> 61<br> 62<br> 63<br> 64<br> 65<br> 66<br> 67<br> 68<br> 69<br> 70<br> 71<br> 72<br> 73<br> 74<br> 75<br> 76<br> 77<br> 78<br> 79<br> 80<br> 81<br> 82<br> 83<br> 84<br> 85<br> 86<br> 87<br> 88<br> 89<br> 90<br> 91<br> 92<br> 93<br> 94<br> 95<br> 96<br> 97<br> 98<br> 99<br>100<br>101<br>102<br>103<br>104<br>105<br>106<br>107<br>108 | `{ \"meta\": { \t\"templateCredsSetupCompleted\": true, \t\"instanceId\": \"cb484ba7b742928a2048bf8829668bed5b5ad9787579adea888f05980292a4a7\" }, \"nodes\": [ \t{ \t\"parameters\": { \t\t\"mode\": \"combine\", \t\t\"mergeByFields\": { \t\t\"values\": [ \t\t\t{ \t\t\t\"field1\": \"name\", \t\t\t\"field2\": \"name\" \t\t\t} \t\t] \t\t}, \t\t\"options\": {} \t}, \t\"id\": \"578365f3-26dd-4fa6-9858-f0a5fdfc413b\", \t\"name\": \"Merge\", \t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.merge\", \t\"typeVersion\": 2.1, \t\"position\": [ \t\t720, \t\t580 \t] \t}, \t{ \t\"parameters\": {}, \t\"id\": \"71aa5aad-afdf-4f8a-bca0-34450eee8acc\", \t\"name\": \"When clicking \\\"Test workflow\\\"\", \t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger\", \t\"typeVersion\": 1, \t\"position\": [ \t\t260, \t\t560 \t] \t}, \t{ \t\"parameters\": { \t\t\"operation\": \"getAllPeople\" \t}, \t\"id\": \"497174fe-3cab-4160-8103-78b44efd038d\", \t\"name\": \"Customer Datastore (n8n training)\", \t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.n8nTrainingCustomerDatastore\", \t\"typeVersion\": 1, \t\"position\": [ \t\t500, \t\t460 \t] \t}, \t{ \t\"parameters\": { \t\t\"jsCode\": \"return [\\n  {\\n    'name': 'Jay Gatsby',\\n    'language': 'English',\\n    'country': {\\n      'code': 'US',\\n      'name': 'United States'\\n    }\\n    \\n  }\\n  \\n];\" \t}, \t\"id\": \"387e8a1e-e796-4f05-8e75-7ce25c786c5f\", \t\"name\": \"Code\", \t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.code\", \t\"typeVersion\": 2, \t\"position\": [ \t\t500, \t\t720 \t] \t} ], \"connections\": { \t\"When clicking \\\"Test workflow\\\"\": { \t\"main\": [ \t\t[ \t\t{ \t\t\t\"node\": \"Customer Datastore (n8n training)\", \t\t\t\"type\": \"main\", \t\t\t\"index\": 0 \t\t}, \t\t{ \t\t\t\"node\": \"Code\", \t\t\t\"type\": \"main\", \t\t\t\"index\": 0 \t\t} \t\t] \t] \t}, \t\"Customer Datastore (n8n training)\": { \t\"main\": [ \t\t[ \t\t{ \t\t\t\"node\": \"Merge\", \t\t\t\"type\": \"main\", \t\t\t\"index\": 0 \t\t} \t\t] \t] \t}, \t\"Code\": { \t\"main\": [ \t\t[ \t\t{ \t\t\t\"node\": \"Merge\", \t\t\t\"type\": \"main\", \t\t\t\"index\": 1 \t\t} \t\t] \t] \t} }, \"pinData\": {} }` |\n\n## Looping[#](#looping \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn some cases, you might need to perform the same operation on each element of an array or each data item (for example sending a message to every contact in your address book). In technical terms, you need to iterate through the data (with loops).\n\nn8n generally handles this repetitive processing automatically, as the nodes run once for each item, so you don't need to build loops into your workflows.\n\nHowever, there are some [exceptions of nodes and operations](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/looping/#node-exceptions) that will require you to build a loop into your workflow.\n\nTo [create a loop in an n8n workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/looping/#using-loops-in-n8n), you need to connect the output of one node to the input of a previous node, and add an **If node** to check when to stop the loop.\n\n## Splitting data in batches[#](#splitting-data-in-batches \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you need to process large volumes of incoming data, execute the **Code node** multiple times, or avoid API rate limits, it's best to split the data into batches (groups) and process these batches.\n\nFor these processes, use the [**Loop Over Items node**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/). This node splits input data into a specified batch size and, with each iteration, returns a predefined amount of data.\n\nExecution of Loop Over Items node\n\nThe **Loop Over Items node** stops executing after all the incoming items get divided into batches and passed on to the next node in the workflow, so it's not necessary to add an **If node** to stop the loop.\n\n### Loop/Batch Exercise[#](#loopbatch-exercise \"Permanent link\")\n\nBuild a workflow that reads the RSS feed from Medium and dev.to. The workflow should consist of three nodes:\n\n1.  A **Code node** that returns the URLs of the RSS feeds of Medium (`https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io`) and dev.to (`https://dev.to/feed/n8n`).\n2.  A **Loop Over Items node** with `Batch Size: 1`, that takes in the inputs from the **Code node** and **RSS Read node** and iterates over the items.\n3.  An **RSS Read node** that gets the URL of the Medium RSS feed, passed as an expression: `{{ $json.url }}`.\n    *   The **RSS Read node** is one of the [exception nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/looping/#node-exceptions) which processes only the first item it receives, so the **Loop Over Items node** is necessary for iterating over multiple items.\n\nShow me the solution\n\n1.  Add a **Code Node**. You can format the code in several ways, one way is:\n    *   Set **Mode** to `Run Once for All Items`.\n    *   Set **Language** to `JavaScript`.\n    *   Copy the code below and paste it into the JavaScript Code editor:\n        \n        |     |     |\n        | --- | --- |\n        | 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13 | `let urls = [ \t{ \t\tjson: { \t\turl: 'https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io' \t\t} \t}, \t{ \tjson: { \t\turl: 'https://dev.to/feed/n8n' \t\t}  \t} ] return urls;` |\n        \n2.  Add a **Loop Over Items node** connected to the **Code node**.\n    *   Set **Batch Size** to `1`.\n3.  The **Loop Over Items node** automatically adds a node called \"Replace Me\". Replace that node with an **RSS Read node**.\n    *   Set the **URL** to use the url from the Code Node: `{{ $json.url }}`.\n\nThe workflow for this exercise looks like this:\n\n![Workflow for getting RSS feeds from two blogs](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-three/exercise_splitinbatches.png)\n\n_Workflow for getting RSS feeds from two blogs_\n\nTo check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br>  2<br>  3<br>  4<br>  5<br>  6<br>  7<br>  8<br>  9<br> 10<br> 11<br> 12<br> 13<br> 14<br> 15<br> 16<br> 17<br> 18<br> 19<br> 20<br> 21<br> 22<br> 23<br> 24<br> 25<br> 26<br> 27<br> 28<br> 29<br> 30<br> 31<br> 32<br> 33<br> 34<br> 35<br> 36<br> 37<br> 38<br> 39<br> 40<br> 41<br> 42<br> 43<br> 44<br> 45<br> 46<br> 47<br> 48<br> 49<br> 50<br> 51<br> 52<br> 53<br> 54<br> 55<br> 56<br> 57<br> 58<br> 59<br> 60<br> 61<br> 62<br> 63<br> 64<br> 65<br> 66<br> 67<br> 68<br> 69<br> 70<br> 71<br> 72<br> 73<br> 74<br> 75<br> 76<br> 77<br> 78<br> 79<br> 80<br> 81<br> 82<br> 83<br> 84<br> 85<br> 86<br> 87<br> 88<br> 89<br> 90<br> 91<br> 92<br> 93<br> 94<br> 95<br> 96<br> 97<br> 98<br> 99<br>100<br>101<br>102<br>103<br>104<br>105<br>106<br>107 | `{ \"meta\": { \t\"templateCredsSetupCompleted\": true, \t\"instanceId\": \"cb484ba7b742928a2048bf8829668bed5b5ad9787579adea888f05980292a4a7\" }, \"nodes\": [ \t{ \t\"parameters\": {}, \t\"id\": \"ed8dc090-ae8c-4db6-a93b-0fa873015c25\", \t\"name\": \"When clicking \\\"Test workflow\\\"\", \t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.manualTrigger\", \t\"typeVersion\": 1, \t\"position\": [ \t\t460, \t\t460 \t] \t}, \t{ \t\"parameters\": { \t\t\"jsCode\": \"let urls = [\\n  {\\n    json: {\\n      url: 'https://medium.com/feed/n8n-io'\\n    }\\n  },\\n  {\\n   json: {\\n     url: 'https://dev.to/feed/n8n'\\n   } \\n  }\\n]\\n\\nreturn urls;\" \t}, \t\"id\": \"1df2a9bf-f970-4e04-b906-92dbbc9e8d3a\", \t\"name\": \"Code\", \t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.code\", \t\"typeVersion\": 2, \t\"position\": [ \t\t680, \t\t460 \t] \t}, \t{ \t\"parameters\": { \t\t\"options\": {} \t}, \t\"id\": \"3cce249a-0eab-42e2-90e3-dbdf3684e012\", \t\"name\": \"Loop Over Items\", \t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.splitInBatches\", \t\"typeVersion\": 3, \t\"position\": [ \t\t900, \t\t460 \t] \t}, \t{ \t\"parameters\": { \t\t\"url\": \"={{ $json.url }}\", \t\t\"options\": {} \t}, \t\"id\": \"50e1c1dc-9a5d-42d3-b7c0-accc31636aa6\", \t\"name\": \"RSS Read\", \t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.rssFeedRead\", \t\"typeVersion\": 1, \t\"position\": [ \t\t1120, \t\t460 \t] \t} ], \"connections\": { \t\"When clicking \\\"Test workflow\\\"\": { \t\"main\": [ \t\t[ \t\t{ \t\t\t\"node\": \"Code\", \t\t\t\"type\": \"main\", \t\t\t\"index\": 0 \t\t} \t\t] \t] \t}, \t\"Code\": { \t\"main\": [ \t\t[ \t\t{ \t\t\t\"node\": \"Loop Over Items\", \t\t\t\"type\": \"main\", \t\t\t\"index\": 0 \t\t} \t\t] \t] \t}, \t\"Loop Over Items\": { \t\"main\": [ \t\tnull, \t\t[ \t\t{ \t\t\t\"node\": \"RSS Read\", \t\t\t\"type\": \"main\", \t\t\t\"index\": 0 \t\t} \t\t] \t] \t}, \t\"RSS Read\": { \t\"main\": [ \t\t[ \t\t{ \t\t\t\"node\": \"Loop Over Items\", \t\t\t\"type\": \"main\", \t\t\t\"index\": 0 \t\t} \t\t] \t] \t} }, \"pinData\": {} }` |"

Make sure that the data containing the credential is available in the workflow when you get to the node that needs it.\n2.  When creating your credential, hover over the field where you want to use an expression.\n3.  Toggle **Expression** on.\n4.  Enter your expression.\n\n### Example workflow[#](#example-workflow \"Permanent link\")\n\n#### Using the example[#](#using-the-example \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo load the template into your n8n instance:\n\n1.  Download the workflow JSON file.\n2.  Open a new workflow in your n8n instance.\n3.  Copy in the JSON, or select **Workflow menu** ![Workflow menu icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/three-dots-horizontal.png) > **Import from file...**.\n\nThe example workflows use Sticky Notes to guide you:\n\n*   Yellow: notes and information.\n*   Green: instructions to run the workflow.\n*   Orange: you need to change something to make the workflow work.\n*   Blue: draws attention to a key feature of the example."

  "markdown": "# Dealing with errors in workflows\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/courses/level-two/chapter-4.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nSometimes you build a nice workflow, but it fails when you try to execute it. Workflow executions may fail for a variety of reasons, ranging from straightforward problems with incorrectly configuring a node or a failure in a third-party service to more mysterious errors.\n\nBut don't panic. In this lesson, you'll learn how you can troubleshoot errors so you can get your workflow up and running as soon as possible.\n\n## Checking failed workflows[#](#checking-failed-workflows \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n tracks executions of your workflows.\n\nWhen one of your workflows fails, you can check the Executions log to see what went wrong. The Executions log shows you a list of the latest execution time, status, mode, and running time of your saved workflows.\n\nOpen the Executions log by selecting [**Executions**](https://docs.n8n.io/editor-ui/#executions) in the left-side panel.\n\nTo investigate a specific failed execution from the list, select the name or the **View** button that appears when you hover over the row of the respective execution.\n\n![Executions log](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-four/explanation_workflowexecutions.png)\n\n_Executions log_\n\nThis will open the workflow in read-only mode, where you can see the execution of each node. This representation can help you identify at what point the workflow ran into issues.\n\nTo toggle between viewing the execution and the editor, select the **Editor | Executions** button at the top of the page.\n\n![Workflow execution view](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-four/explanation_workflowexecutions_readonly.png)\n\n_Workflow execution view_\n\n## Catching erroring workflows[#](#catching-erroring-workflows \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo catch failed workflows, create a separate [**Error Workflow**](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/error-handling/error-workflows/) with the [**Error Trigger node**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.errortrigger/). This workflow will only execute if the main workflow execution fails.\n\nUse additional nodes in your **Error Workflow** that make sense, like sending notifications about the failed workflow and its errors using email or Slack.\n\nTo receive error messages for a failed workflow, set the **Error Workflow** in the [Workflow Settings](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/) to an Error Workflow that uses an **Error Trigger node**.\n\nThe only difference between a regular workflow and an Error Workflow is that the latter contains an **Error Trigger node**. Make sure to create this node before you set this as another workflow's designated Error Workflow.\n\nError workflows\n\n*   If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to activate the workflow.\n*   If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow.\n*   You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors.\n*   You can set the same Error Workflow for multiple workflows.\n\n### Exercise[#](#exercise \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn the previous chapters, you've built several small workflows. Now, pick one of them that you want to monitor and create an Error Workflow for it:\n\n1.  Create a new Error Workflow.\n2.  Add the **Error Trigger node**.\n3.  Connect a node for the communication platform of your choice to the Error Trigger node, like [Slack](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/), [Discord](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/), [Telegram](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/), or even [Gmail](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) or a more generic [Send Email](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sendemail/).\n4.  In the workflow you want to monitor, open the [Workflow Settings](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/) and select the new Error Workflow you just created. Note that this workflow needs to run automatically to trigger the error workflow.\n\nShow me the solution\n\nThe workflow for this exercise looks like this:\n\n![](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-four/exercise_errors_errortriggernode_workflow.png)\n\n_Error workflow_\n\nTo check the configuration of the nodes, you can copy the JSON workflow code below and paste it into your Editor UI:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29<br>30<br>31<br>32<br>33<br>34<br>35<br>36<br>37<br>38<br>39<br>40<br>41<br>42<br>43<br>44<br>45<br>46<br>47<br>48 | `{ \t\"nodes\": [ \t\t{ \t\t\t\"parameters\": {}, \t\t\t\"name\": \"Error Trigger\", \t\t\t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.errorTrigger\", \t\t\t\"typeVersion\": 1, \t\t\t\"position\": [ \t\t\t\t720, \t\t\t\t-380 \t\t\t] \t\t}, \t\t{ \t\t\t\"parameters\": { \t\t\t\t\"channel\": \"channelname\", \t\t\t\t\"text\": \"=This workflow {{$node[\\\"Error Trigger\\\"].json[\\\"workflow\\\"][\\\"name\\\"]}}failed.\\nHave a look at it here: {{$node[\\\"Error Trigger\\\"].json[\\\"execution\\\"][\\\"url\\\"]}}\", \t\t\t\t\"attachments\": [], \t\t\t\t\"otherOptions\": {} \t\t\t}, \t\t\t\"name\": \"Slack\", \t\t\t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.slack\", \t\t\t\"position\": [ \t\t\t\t900, \t\t\t\t-380 \t\t\t], \t\t\t\"typeVersion\": 1, \t\t\t\"credentials\": { \t\t\t\t\"slackApi\": { \t\t\t\t\t\"id\": \"17\", \t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"slack_credentials\" \t\t\t\t} \t\t\t} \t\t} \t], \t\"connections\": { \t\t\"Error Trigger\": { \t\t\t\"main\": [ \t\t\t\t[ \t\t\t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\t\t\"node\": \"Slack\", \t\t\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"main\", \t\t\t\t\t\t\"index\": 0 \t\t\t\t\t} \t\t\t\t] \t\t\t] \t\t} \t} }` |\n\n## Throwing exceptions in workflows[#](#throwing-exceptions-in-workflows \"Permanent link\")\n\nAnother way of troubleshooting workflows is to include a [**Stop and Error node**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) in your workflow. This node throws an error. You can specify the error type:\n\n*   **Error Message**: returns a custom message about the error\n*   **Error Object**: returns the type of error\n\nYou can only use the **Stop and Error node** as the last node in a workflow.\n\nWhen to throw errors\n\nThrowing exceptions with the **Stop and Error node** is useful for verifying the data (or assumptions about the data) from a node and returning custom error messages.\n\nIf you are working with data from a third-party service, you may come across problems such as:\n\n*   Wrongly formatted JSON output\n*   Data with the wrong type (for example, numeric data that has a non-numeric value)\n*   Missing values\n*   Errors from remote servers\n\nThough this kind of invalid data might not cause the workflow to fail right away, it could cause problems later on, and then it can become difficult to track the source error. This is why it's better to throw an error at the time you know there might be a problem.\n\n![Stop and Error node with error message](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-four/exercise_errors_stopanderror.png)\n\n_Stop and Error node with error message_"

With an error workflow, you can control how n8n responds to a workflow execution failure.\n\n## Create and set an error workflow[#](#create-and-set-an-error-workflow \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor each workflow, you can set an error workflow in **Workflow Settings**. It runs if an execution fails. This means you can, for example, send email or Slack alerts when a workflow execution errors. The error workflow must start with the [Error Trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.errortrigger/).\n\nYou can use the same error workflow for multiple workflows.\n\n1.  Create a new workflow, with the Error Trigger as the first node.\n2.  Give the workflow a name, for example `Error Handler`.\n3.  Select **Save**.\n4.  In the workflow where you want to use this error workflow:\n    1.  Select **Options** ![Options menu icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) > **Settings**.\n    2.  In **Error workflow**, select the workflow you just created. For example, if you used the name Error Handler, select **Error handler**.\n    3.  Select **Save**. Now, when this workflow errors, the related error workflow runs.\n\n## Error data[#](#error-data \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe default error data received by the Error Trigger is:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19 | `[ \t{ \t\t\"execution\": { \t\t\t\"id\": \"231\", \t\t\t\"url\": \"https://n8n.example.com/execution/231\", \t\t\t\"retryOf\": \"34\", \t\t\t\"error\": { \t\t\t\t\"message\": \"Example Error Message\", \t\t\t\t\"stack\": \"Stacktrace\" \t\t\t}, \t\t\t\"lastNodeExecuted\": \"Node With Error\", \t\t\t\"mode\": \"manual\" \t\t}, \t\t\"workflow\": { \t\t\t\"id\": \"1\", \t\t\t\"name\": \"Example Workflow\" \t\t} \t} ]` |\n\nAll information is always present, except:\n\n*   `execution.id`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.\n*   `execution.url`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.\n*   `execution.retryOf`: only present when the execution is a retry of a failed execution.\n\nIf the error is caused by the trigger node of the main workflow, rather than a later stage, the data sent to the error workflow is different. There's less information in `execution{}` and more in `trigger{}`:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22 | `{   \"trigger\": {     \"error\": {       \"context\": {},       \"name\": \"WorkflowActivationError\",       \"cause\": {         \"message\": \"\",         \"stack\": \"\"       },       \"timestamp\": 1654609328787,       \"message\": \"\",       \"node\": {         . . .        }     },     \"mode\": \"trigger\"   },   \"workflow\": {     \"id\": \"\",     \"name\": \"\"   } }` |\n\n## Cause a workflow execution failure using Stop And Error[#](#cause-a-workflow-execution-failure-using-stop-and-error \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen you create and set an error workflow, n8n runs it when an execution fails. Usually, this is due to things like errors in node settings, or the workflow running out of memory.\n\nYou can add the [Stop And Error](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) node to your workflow to force executions to fail under your chosen circumstances, and trigger the error workflow."

  "markdown": "# Cloud data management | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/manage-cloud/cloud-data-management.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nThere are two concerns when managing data on Cloud:\n\n*   Memory usage: complex workflows processing large amounts of data can exceed n8n's memory limits. If this happens, the instance can crash and become inaccessible.\n*   Data storage: depending on your execution settings and volume, your n8n database can grow in size and run out of storage.\n\nTo avoid these issues, n8n recommends that you build your workflows with memory efficiency in mind, and don't save unnecessary data\n\n## Memory limits on each Cloud plan[#](#memory-limits-on-each-cloud-plan \"Permanent link\")\n\nCurrent plans:\n\n*   Trial: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable\n*   Starter: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable\n*   Pro-1 (10k executions): 640MiB RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable\n*   Pro-2 (50k executions): 1280MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable\n*   Enterprise: 4096MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable\n\nLegacy plans:\n\n*   Start: 320MiB RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable\n*   Power: 1280MiB RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable\n\nn8n gives each instance up to 100GB of data storage.\n\n## How to reduce memory consumption in your workflow[#](#how-to-reduce-memory-consumption-in-your-workflow \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe way you build workflows affects how much data they consume when executed. Although these guidelines aren't applicable to all cases, they provide a baseline of best practices to avoid exceeding instance memory.\n\n*   Split the data processed into smaller chunks. For example, instead of fetching 10,000 rows with each execution, process 200 rows with each execution.\n*   Avoid using the Code node where possible.\n*   Avoid manual executions when processing larger amounts of data.\n*   Split the workflow up into sub-workflows and ensure each sub-workflow returns a limited amount of data to its parent workflow.\n\nSplitting the workflow might seem counter-intuitive at first as it usually requires adding at least two more nodes: the [Loop Over Items](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node to split up the items into smaller batches and the [Execute Workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node to start the sub-workflow.\n\nHowever, as long as your sub-workflow does the heavy lifting for each batch and then returns only a small result set to the main workflow, this reduces memory consumption. This is because the sub-workflow only holds the data for the current batch in memory, after which the memory is free again.\n\nNote that n8n itself consumes memory to run. On average, the software alone uses around 180MiB RAM.\n\nInteractions with the UI also consume memory. Playing around with the workflow UI while it performs heavy executions could also push the memory capacity over the limit.\n\n## How to manage execution data on Cloud[#](#how-to-manage-execution-data-on-cloud \"Permanent link\")\n\nExecution data includes node data, parameters, variables, execution context, and binary data references. It's text-based.\n\nBinary data is non-textual data that n8n can't represent as plain text. This is files and media such as images, documents, audio files, and videos. It's much larger than textual data.\n\nIf a workflow consumes a large amounts of data and is past testing stage, it's a good option to stop saving the successful executions.\n\nThere are two ways you can control how much execution data n8n stores in the database:\n\nIn the admin dashboard:\n\n1.  From your workspace or editor, navigate to **Admin Panel**.\n2.  Select **Manage**.\n3.  In **Executions to Save** deselect the executions you don't want to log.\n\nIn your workflow settings:\n\n1.  Select the **Options** ![Options menu](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) menu.\n2.  Select **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.\n3.  Change **Save successful production executions** to **Do not save**.\n\n## Cloud data pruning and out of memory incident prevention[#](#cloud-data-pruning-and-out-of-memory-incident-prevention \"Permanent link\")\n\n### Automatic data pruning[#](#automatic-data-pruning \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n automatically prunes execution logs after a certain time or once you reach the max storage limit, whichever comes first. The pruning always happens from oldest to newest and the limits depend on your Could plan:\n\n*   Start and Starter plans: max 2500 executions saved and 7 days execution log retention;\n*   Pro and Power plans: max 25000 executions saved and 30 days execution log retention;\n*   Enterprise plan: max 50000 executions saved and unlimited execution log retention time.\n\n### Manual data pruning[#](#manual-data-pruning \"Permanent link\")\n\nHeavier executions and use cases can exceed database capacity despite the automatic pruning practices. In cases like this, n8n will manually prune data to protect instance stability.\n\n1.  An alert system warns n8n if an instance is at 85% disk capacity.\n2.  n8n prunes execution data. n8n does this by running a backup of the instance (workflows, users, credentials and execution data) and restoring it without execution data.\n\nDue to the human steps in this process, the alert system isn't perfect. If warnings are triggered after hours or if data consumption rates are high, there might not be time to prune the data before the remaining disk space fills up."

Its aim is to allow you to try out the UI, and introduce you to two key features: workflow templates and expressions. It doesn't include detailed explanations or explore concepts.\n\nYou will:\n\n*   Load a workflow from the workflow templates library\n*   Add a node and configure it using expressions.\n*   Run your first workflow\n\n## Step one: Sign up for n8n[#](#step-one-sign-up-for-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nSkip this section if you've already installed n8n or signed up for a Cloud account\n\nn8n is available as a [Cloud](https://docs.n8n.io/choose-n8n/cloud/) service, [npm](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/) module, and [Docker](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/) image. For this quickstart, n8n recommends using Cloud. A free trial is available for new users.\n\n## Step two: Open a workflow template[#](#step-two-open-a-workflow-template \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n provides a quickstart template using training nodes. This allows you to work with fake data, and avoids setting up credentials.\n\n1.  Go to [Templates | Very quick quickstart](https://n8n.io/workflows/1700-very-quick-quickstart/).\n2.  Select **Use workflow** to view the options for using the template.\n3.  Select **Import template to cloud workspace** to load the template into your Cloud instance.\n\nThis workflow:\n\n1.  Gets example data from the Customer Datastore node.\n2.  Uses the Edit Fields node to extract just the data you want, and assign that data to variables. In this example, you use the customer name, ID, and description.\n\nThe individual pieces in an n8n workflow are called nodes. Double click a node to explore its settings and how it processes data.\n\n## Step three: Run the workflow[#](#step-three-run-the-workflow \"Permanent link\")\n\nSelect **Test Workflow**. This runs the workflow, loading the data from the Customer Datastore node, then transforming it with Edit Fields. You need this data available in the workflow so that you can work with it in the next step.\n\n## Step four: Add a node[#](#step-four-add-a-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nAdd a third node to message each customer and tell them their description. Use the Customer Messenger node to send a message to fake recipients.\n\n1.  Select the **Add node** ![Add node icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) connector on the Edit Fields node.\n2.  Search for **Customer Messenger**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\n3.  Select **Customer Messenger (n8n training)** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node automatically.\n4.  Use [expressions](https://docs.n8n.io/code/expressions/) to map in the **Customer ID** and create the **Message**:\n    1.  Drag **customer\\_id** from the **INPUT** panel into the **Customer ID** field in the node settings.\n    2.  Hover over **Message**. Select the **Expression** tab, then select the expand button ![Add node icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png) to open the full expressions editor.\n    3.  Copy this expression into the editor:\n        \n        |     |     |\n        | --- | --- |\n        |     | `Hi {{$json.customer_name}},  Your description is {{$json.customer_description}}` |\n        \n5.  Close the expressions editor, then close the **Customer Messenger** node by clicking outside the node or selecting **Back to canvas**.\n6.  Select **Test Workflow**. n8n runs the workflow.\n\nThe complete workflow should look like this:\n\n![Screenshot of completed quickstart workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/try-it-out/quickstart/very-quick-quickstart-workflow.png)\n\n## Next steps[#](#next-steps \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   Read n8n's [longer try it out tutorial](https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/longer-introduction/) for a more complex workflow, and an introduction to more features and n8n concepts.\n*   Take the [text courses](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/) or [video courses](https://docs.n8n.io/video-courses/)."

My manager was so impressed with my first workflow automation solution that she entrusted me with more responsibility.  \n**You 👩‍🔧:** More work and responsibility. Congratulations, I guess. What do you need to do now?  \n**Nathan 🙋:** I got access to all our sales data and I'm now responsible for creating two reports: one for regional sales and one for orders prices. They're based on data from different sources and come in different formats.  \n**You 👩‍🔧:** Sounds like a lot of manual work, but the kind that can be automated. Let's do it!\n\n## Workflow design[#](#workflow-design \"Permanent link\")\n\nNow that we know what Nathan wants to automate, let's list the steps he needs to take to achieve this:\n\n1.  Get and combine data from all necessary sources.\n2.  Sort the data and format the dates.\n3.  Write binary files.\n4.  Send notifications using email and Discord.\n\nn8n provides [core nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/node-types/#core-nodes) for all these steps. This use case is somewhat complex. We should build it from three separate workflows:\n\n1.  A workflow that merges the company data with external information.\n2.  A workflow that generates the reports.\n3.  A workflow that monitors errors in the second workflow.\n\n## Workflow prerequisites[#](#workflow-prerequisites \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo build the workflows, you will need the following:\n\n*   An [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) account and [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/).\n*   A [Google](https://www.google.com/account/about/) account and [credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/) to access Gmail.\n*   A [Discord](https://discord.com/) account and webhook URL (you receive this using email when you sign up for this course).\n\nNext, you will build these three workflows with step-by-step instructions."

  "markdown": "# Sub-workflows | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/flow-logic/subworkflows.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nYou can call one workflow from another workflow. This allows you to build modular, microservice-like workflows. It can also help if your workflow grows large enough to encounter [memory issues](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/memory-errors/). Creating sub-workflows uses the [Execute Workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) and [Execute Workflow Trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflowtrigger/) nodes.\n\n## Set up and use a sub-workflow[#](#set-up-and-use-a-sub-workflow \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis section walks through setting up both the parent workflow and sub-workflow.\n\n### Create the sub-workflow[#](#create-the-sub-workflow \"Permanent link\")\n\n1.  Create a new workflow.\n    \n    Create sub-workflows from existing workflows\n    \n    You can optionally create a sub-workflow directly from an existing parent workflow using the [Execute Workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node. In the node, select the **Database** and **From list** options and select **Create a sub-workflow** in the list.\n    \n2.  **Optional**: configure which workflows can call the sub-workflow:\n    \n    1.  Select the **Options** ![Options menu](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) menu > **Settings**. n8n opens the **Workflow settings** modal.\n    2.  Change the **This workflow can be called by** setting. Refer to [Workflow settings](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/) for more information on configuring your workflows.\n3.  Add the **Execute Workflow Trigger** node.\n4.  Set the **Input data mode** to choose how you will define the sub-workflow's input data:\n    *   **Define using fields below**: Choose this mode to define individual input names and data types that the calling workflow needs to provide.\n    *   **Define using JSON example**: Choose this mode to provide an example JSON object that demonstrates the expected input items and their types.\n    *   **Accept all data**: Choose this mode to accept all data unconditionally. The sub-workflow won't define any required input items. This sub-workflow must handle any input inconsistencies or missing values.\n5.  Add other nodes as needed to build your sub-workflow functionality.\n6.  Save the sub-workflow.\n\nSub-workflow mustn't contain errors\n\nIf there are errors in the sub-workflow, the parent workflow can't trigger it.\n\nLoad data into sub-workflow before building\n\nThis requires the ability to [load data from previous executions](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/debug/), which is available on n8n Cloud and registered Community plans.\n\nIf you want to load data into your sub-workflow to use while building it:\n\n1.  Create the sub-workflow and add the **Execute Workflow Trigger**.\n2.  Set the node's **Input data mode** to **Accept all data** or define the input items using fields or JSON if they're already known.\n3.  In the sub-workflow [settings](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/), set **Save successful production executions** to **Save**.\n4.  Skip ahead to setting up the parent workflow, and run it.\n5.  Follow the steps to [load data from previous executions](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/debug/).\n6.  Adjust the **Input data mode** to match the input sent by the parent workflow if necessary.\n\nYou can now pin example data in the trigger node, enabling you to work with real data while configuring the rest of the workflow.\n\n### Call the sub-workflow[#](#call-the-sub-workflow \"Permanent link\")\n\n1.  Open the workflow where you want to call the sub-workflow.\n2.  Add the **Execute Workflow** node.\n3.  In the **Execute Workflow** node, set the sub-workflow you want to call. You can choose to call the workflow by ID, load a workflow from a local file, add workflow JSON as a parameter in the node, or target a workflow by URL.\n    \n    Find your workflow ID\n    \n    Your sub-workflow's ID is the alphanumeric string at the end of its URL.\n    \n4.  Fill in the required input items defined by the sub-workflow.\n    \n5.  Save your workflow.\n\nWhen your workflow executes, it will send data to the sub-workflow, and run it.\n\nYou can follow the execution flow from the parent workflow to the sub-workflow by opening the Execute Workflow node and selecting the **View sub-execution** link. Likewise, the sub-workflow's execution contains a link back to the parent workflow's execution to navigate in the other direction.\n\n## How data passes between workflows[#](#how-data-passes-between-workflows \"Permanent link\")\n\nAs an example, imagine you have an Execute Workflow node in **Workflow A**. The Execute Workflow node calls another workflow called **Workflow B**:\n\n1.  The Execute Workflow node passes the data to the Execute Workflow Trigger node of **Workflow B**.\n2.  The last node of **Workflow B** sends the data back to the Execute Workflow node in **Workflow A**."

  "markdown": "# A longer introduction | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/try-it-out/longer-introduction.md \"Edit this page\")\n\n## A slightly longer introduction[#](#a-slightly-longer-introduction \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis guide shows you how to automate a task using a workflow in n8n, explaining key concepts along the way. You will:\n\n*   Create a workflow from scratch. You'll build a workflow that runs every week to get data from NASA, filters the data, and generates two reports.\n*   Understand key concepts and skills, including:\n    *   Starting workflows with trigger nodes\n    *   Configuring credentials\n    *   Manipulating data\n    *   Representing logic in an n8n workflow\n    *   Using expressions\n\n## Step one: Sign up for n8n[#](#step-one-sign-up-for-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nSkip this section if you've already installed n8n or signed up for a Cloud account\n\nn8n is available as a [Cloud](https://docs.n8n.io/choose-n8n/cloud/) service, [npm](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/) module, and [Docker](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/) image. For this quickstart, n8n recommends using Cloud. A free trial is available for new users.\n\n## Step two: New workflow[#](#step-two-new-workflow \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen you open n8n, you'll see either:\n\n*   An empty workflow: if you have no workflows and you're logging in for the first time. Use this workflow.\n*   The **Workflows** list on the **Overview** page. Select the ![universal create resource icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png) **button** to create a new workflow.\n\n## Step three: Add a trigger node[#](#step-three-add-a-trigger-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n provides two ways to start a workflow:\n\n*   Manually, by selecting **Test Workflow**, or from the CLI if you installed n8n with npm or Docker.\n*   Automatically, using a trigger node as the first node. The trigger node runs the workflow in response to an external event, or based on your settings.\n\nFor this tutorial, use the [Schedule trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/). This allows you to run the workflow on a schedule:\n\n1.  Select **Add first step**.\n2.  Search for **Schedule**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\n3.  Select **Schedule Trigger** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.\n4.  For **Trigger Interval**, select **Weeks**.\n5.  For **Weeks Between Triggers**, enter `1`.\n6.  Enter a time and day. For this example, select **Monday** in **Trigger on Weekdays**, select **9am** in **Trigger at Hour**, and enter `0` in **Trigger at Minute**.\n7.  Close the node details view to return to the canvas.\n\n## Step four: Add the NASA node and set up credentials[#](#step-four-add-the-nasa-node-and-set-up-credentials \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe [NASA node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.nasa/) allows you to interact with NASA's [public APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/). The API gives you data to work with in this tutorial.\n\n1.  Select the **Add node** ![Add node icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) connector on the Schedule Trigger node.\n2.  Search for **NASA**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\n3.  Select **NASA** to view a list of operations.\n4.  Search for and select **Get a DONKI solar flare**. This operation returns a report about recent solar flares. When you select the operation, n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.\n5.  To access the NASA APIs, you need to set up credentials:\n    1.  Select the **Credential for NASA API** dropdown.\n    2.  Select **\\- Create New -**. n8n opens the credentials view.\n    3.  Go to [NASA APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/) and fill out the form in **Generate API Key**. NASA generates the key and displays it.\n    4.  Copy the key, and paste it into **API Key** in n8n.\n    5.  Select **Save**.\n    6.  Close the credentials screen. n8n returns to the node. The new credentials should be automatically selected in **Credential for NASA API**.\n6.  By default, DONKI Solar Flare provides data for the past 30 days. To limit it to just the last week, use **Additional Fields**:\n    \n    1.  Select **Add field**.\n    2.  Select **Start date**.\n    3.  To get a report starting from a week ago, you can use an expression: next to **Start date**, select the **Expression** tab, then select the expand button ![Add node icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png) to open the full expressions editor.\n    4.  In the **Expression** field, enter the following expression:\n        \n        |     |     |\n        | --- | --- |\n        |     | `{{$today.minus({days: 7}).toFormat('yyyy-MM-dd')}}` |\n        \n        This generates a date in the correct format, seven days before the current date.\n    \n    Date and time in n8n\n    \n    n8n uses Luxon to work with date and time, and also provides two variables for convenience: `$now` and `$today`. For more information, refer to [Expressions > Luxon](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/).\n    \n7.  Close the **Edit Expression** modal to return to the NASA node.\n    \n8.  You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select **Test step** to run the node manually. n8n calls the NASA API and displays details of solar flares in the past seven days in the **OUTPUT** section.\n9.  Close the NASA node to return to the workflow canvas.\n\n## Step five: Add logic with the If node[#](#step-five-add-logic-with-the-if-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n supports complex logic in workflows. In this tutorial, use the [If node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if) to create two branches that each generate a report from the NASA data. Solar flares have five possible classifications. You'll create logic that sends a report with the lower classifications to one output, and the higher classifications to another.\n\nAdd the If node:\n\n1.  Select the **Add node** ![Add node icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) connector on the NASA node.\n2.  Search for **If**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\n3.  Select **If** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.\n4.  You need to check the value of the `classType` property in the NASA data. To do this:\n    \n    1.  Drag **classType** into **Value 1**.\n        \n        Make sure you ran the NASA node in the previous section\n        \n        If you didn't follow the step in the previous section to run the NASA node, you won't see any data to work with in this step.\n        \n    2.  Change the comparison operation to **String > Contains**.\n        \n    3.  In **Value 2**, enter **X**. This is the highest classification of solar flare. In the next step, you will create two reports: one for X class solar flares, and one for all the smaller solar flares.\n    4.  You can now check that the node is working and returning the expected date: select **Test step** to run the node manually. n8n tests the data against the condition, and shows which results match true or false in the **OUTPUT** panel.\n\nWeeks without large solar flares\n\nIn this tutorial, you are working with live date. If you find there aren't any X class solar flares when you run the workflow, try replacing **X** in **Value 2** with either **A**, **B**, **C**, or **M**.\n\n5.  Once you are happy the node will return some events, you can close the node to return to the canvas.\n\n## Step six: Output data from your workflow[#](#step-six-output-data-from-your-workflow \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe last step of the workflow is to send the two reports about solar flares. For this example, you'll send data to [Postbin](https://www.toptal.com/developers/postbin/). Postbin is a service that receives data and displays it on a temporary web page.\n\n1.  On the If node, select the **Add node** ![Add node icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/try-it-out/add-node.png) connector labeled **true**.\n2.  Search for **PostBin**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\n3.  Select **PostBin**.\n4.  Select **Send a request**. n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.\n5.  Go to [Postbin](https://www.toptal.com/developers/postbin/) and select **Create Bin**. Leave the tab open so you can come back to it when testing the workflow.\n6.  Copy the bin ID. It looks similar to `1651063625300-2016451240051`.\n7.  In n8n, paste your Postbin ID into **Bin ID**.\n8.  Now, configure the data to send to Postbin. Next to **Bin Content**, select the **Expression** tab (you will need to mouse-over the **Bin Content** for the tab to appear), then select the expand button ![Add node icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/open-expression-editor.png) to open the full expressions editor.\n9.  Select **Current Node** > **Input Data** > **JSON** > **classType**. n8n adds the expression to the **Expression** editor, and displays a sample output.\n10.  The expression is: `{{$json[\"classType\"]}}`. Add a message to it, so that the full expression is:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `There was a solar flare of class {{$json[\"classType\"]}}` |\n    \n11.  Close the expressions editor to return to the node.\n12.  Close the Postbin node to return to the canvas.\n13.  Add another Postbin node, to handle the **false** output path from the If node:\n    1.  Hover over the Postbin node, then select **Node context menu** ![Node context menu icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/node-context-menu.png) > **Duplicate node** to duplicate the first Postbin node.\n    2.  Drag the **false** connector from the If node to the left side of the new Postbin node.\n\n## Step seven: Test the workflow[#](#step-seven-test-the-workflow \"Permanent link\")\n\n1.  You can now test the entire workflow. Select **Test Workflow**. n8n runs the workflow, showing each stage in progress.\n2.  Go back to your Postbin bin. Refresh the page to see the output.\n3.  If you want to use this workflow (in other words, if you want it to run once a week automatically), you need to activate it by selecting the **Active** toggle.\n\nTime limit\n\nPostbin's bins exist for 30 minutes after creation. You may need to create a new bin and update the ID in the Postbin nodes, if you exceed this time limit.\n\n## Next steps[#](#next-steps \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   Take n8n's [text courses](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/) or [video courses](https://docs.n8n.io/video-courses/).\n*   Explore more examples in [workflow templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)."

Maybe you're tired of manually entering data into the same spreadsheet every day, of clicking through a series of tabs and buttons for that one piece of information you need, of managing tens of different tools and systems.\n\nWhatever the reason, one thing is clear: you shouldn't spend precious time doing things that don't spark joy or contribute to your personal and professional growth.\n\nThese tasks can and should be automated!

To prevent this and improve instance stability, n8n sets concurrency limits for production executions in regular mode.\n\nAny executions beyond the limits queue for later processing. These executions remain in the queue until concurrency capacity frees up, and are then processed in FIFO order.\n\n## Concurrency limits[#](#concurrency-limits \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n limits the number of concurrent executions for Cloud instances according to their plan:\n\n*   Starter and Trial: 5\n*   Pro (10k workflow executions, 15 active workflows): 20\n*   Pro (50k workflow executions, 50 active workflows): 50\n*   Enterprise (in regular mode): 200\n\nYou can view the number of active executions and your plan's concurrency limit at the top of a project's or workflow's executions tab.\n\n## Details[#](#details \"Permanent link\")\n\nSome other details about concurrency to keep in mind:\n\n*   Concurrency control applies only to production executions: those started from a webhook or trigger node. It doesn't apply to any other kinds, such as manual executions, sub-workflow executions, or error executions.\n*   You can't retry queued executions. Cancelling or deleting a queued execution also removes it from the queue.\n*   On instance startup, n8n resumes queued executions up to the concurrency limit and re-enqueues the rest.\n\n## Comparison to queue mode[#](#comparison-to-queue-mode \"Permanent link\")\n\nFeature availability\n\nQueue mode is available for Cloud Enterprise plans. To enable it, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa).\n\nConcurrency in queue mode is a separate mechanism from concurrency in regular mode. In queue mode, the concurrency settings determine how many jobs each worker can run in parallel. In regular mode, concurrency limits apply to the entire instance."

  "markdown": "# Data structure | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/data-structure.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nIn n8n, all data passed between nodes is an array of objects. It has the following structure:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24 | `[ \t{ \t\t// For most data: \t\t// Wrap each item in another object, with the key 'json' \t\t\"json\": { \t\t\t// Example data \t\t\t\"apple\": \"beets\", \t\t\t\"carrot\": { \t\t\t\t\"dill\": 1 \t\t\t} \t\t}, \t\t// For binary data: \t\t// Wrap each item in another object, with the key 'binary' \t\t\"binary\": { \t\t\t// Example data \t\t\t\"apple-picture\": { \t\t\t\t\"data\": \"....\", // Base64 encoded binary data (required) \t\t\t\t\"mimeType\": \"image/png\", // Best practice to set if possible (optional) \t\t\t\t\"fileExtension\": \"png\", // Best practice to set if possible (optional) \t\t\t\t\"fileName\": \"example.png\", // Best practice to set if possible (optional) \t\t\t} \t\t} \t}, ]` |\n\nSkipping the `json` key and array syntax\n\nFrom 0.166.0 on, when using the Function node or Code node, n8n automatically adds the `json` key if it's missing. It also automatically wraps your items in an array (`[]`) if needed. This is only the case when using the Function or Code nodes. When building your own nodes, you must still make sure the node returns data with the `json` key.\n\n## Data item processing[#](#data-item-processing \"Permanent link\")\n\nNodes can process multiple items.\n\nFor example, if you set the Trello node to `Create-Card`, and create an expression that sets `Name` using a property called `name-input-value` from the incoming data, the node creates a card for each item, always choosing the `name-input-value` of the current item.\n\nFor example, this input will create two cards. One named `test1` the other one named `test2`:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `[ \t{ \t\tname-input-value: \"test1\" \t}, \t{ \t\tname-input-value: \"test2\" \t} ]` |"

Use the [**Airtable node**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/) to list the data in the Airtable table named `customers`.\n2.  Use the [**HTTP Request node**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to get data from the REST Countries API: `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all`. This will return data about world countries, split out into separate items.\n3.  Use the [**Merge node**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge/) to merge data from Airtable and the Countries API by country name, represented as `customerCountry` in Airtable and `name.common` in the Countries API, respectively.\n4.  Use another Airtable node to update the fields `region` and `subregion` in Airtable with the data from the Countries API.\n\nThe workflow should look like this:\n\n[![Workflow 1 for merging data from Airtable and the Countries API](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow1.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-two/chapter-five/workflow1.png)\n\n_Workflow 1 for merging data from Airtable and the Countries API_\n\nQuiz questions\n\n*   How many items does the **HTTP Request node** return?\n*   How many items does the **Merge node** return?\n*   How many unique regions are assigned in the customers table?\n*   What's the subregion assigned to the customerID 10?"

We will walk through the canvas and show you what each icon means and where to find things you will need while building workflows in n8n.\n\n## Getting started[#](#getting-started \"Permanent link\")\n\nBegin by setting up n8n. There are two ways you can do this:\n\n*   [n8n Cloud](https://app.n8n.cloud/register) - Hosted solution, no installation needed. Great for all levels of experience.\n*   [Self-host](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/) - Recommended for advanced users with technical knowledge\n\nFor more details on the different ways to set up n8n, see our [platforms documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/choose-n8n/#platforms).\n\nn8n version\n\nThis course was developed on n8n version 1.30.0. In other versions, some of the user interface might look different, but the core functionality shouldn't be impacted.\n\nOnce you have n8n running, open the Editor UI in a browser window. It should look like this:\n\n![Editor UI](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-editor-ui.png)\n\n_Editor UI_\n\n## Editor UI settings[#](#editor-ui-settings \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe [Editor UI](https://docs.n8n.io/editor-ui/) is the web interface where you build [workflows](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/workflows/). You can access all your workflows and credentials, as well as support pages, from the Editor UI.\n\n### Left-side panel[#](#left-side-panel \"Permanent link\")\n\nOn the left side of the **Editor UI**, there is a panel which contains the core functionalities and settings for managing your workflows. Expand and collapse it by selecting the small arrow icon.\n\nThe panel contains the following sections:\n\n*   **Overview**: Contains all the workflows and credentials you have access to. During this course, create new workflows here.\n*   **Templates**: A collection of pre-made workflows. Great place to get started with common use cases.\n*   **Variables**: Used to store and access fixed data across your workflows. This feature is available on the Pro and Enterprise Plans.\n*   **All executions**: Contains information about your workflow executions.\n*   **Settings**: Manage users and access settings for a variety of features.\n*   **Help**: Contains resources around n8n product and community.\n*   **Admin Panel**: n8n Cloud only. Access your n8n instance usage, billing, and version settings.\n*   **Update**: n8n Cloud only. Indicator for any recently released product updates.\n\n![Editor UI left-side menu](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-side-panel.png)\n\n_Editor UI left-side menu_\n\n### Top bar[#](#top-bar \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe top bar of the **Editor UI** contains the following information:\n\n*   **Workflow Name**: By default, n8n names a new workflow as “My Workflow,” but you can edit the name at any time.\n*   **+Add Tag**: Tags help you organise your workflows by category, use case, or whatever is relevant for you. Tags are optional.\n*   **Inactive/active toggle**: This button activates or deactivates the current workflow. By default, workflows are deactivated.\n*   **Share**: You can share and collaborate with others on workflows on the Starter, Pro, and Enterprise plans.\n*   **Save**: This button saves the current workflow.\n\n![Editor UI top bar](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-top-bar.png)\n\n_Editor UI top bar_\n\n### Canvas[#](#canvas \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe **canvas** is the gray dotted grid background in the Editor UI. It displays several icons and a node with different functionalities:\n\n*   Buttons to zoom the canvas to fit the screen, zoom in or out of the canvas, and reset the canvas to the original resolution.\n*   A button to **Execute Workflow**. When you click on it, all nodes on the canvas are executed.\n*   A button with a **+** sign inside. This button opens the nodes panel.\n*   A button with a note icon inside. This button adds a [sticky note](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/sticky-notes) to the canvas. (Visible when hovering on the top right + icon)\n*   A dotted square with the text \"Add first step.\" This is where you add your first node.\n\n![Workflow canvas](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-canvas.png)\n\n_Workflow canvas_\n\nMoving the canvas\n\nYou can move the workflow canvas around in three ways:\n\n*   Select **Ctrl + Left Mouse Button** on the canvas and move it around.\n*   Select **Middle Mouse Button** on the canvas and move it around.\n*   Place two fingers on your touchpad and slide.\n\nDon't worry about workflow execution and activation for now; we'll explain these concepts later on in the course.\n\n## Nodes[#](#nodes \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can think of nodes as building blocks that serve different functions that, when put together, make up a functioning machine: an automated workflow.\n\nNode\n\nA node is an individual step in your workflow: one that either (a) loads, (b) processes, or (c) sends data.\n\nBased on their function, n8n classifies nodes into four types:\n\n*   **App** or **Action Nodes** add, remove, and edit data; request and send external data; and trigger events in other systems. Refer to the [Action nodes library](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/) for a full list of these nodes.\n*   **Trigger Nodes** start a workflow and supply the initial data. Refer to the [Trigger nodes library](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/) for a full list of trigger nodes.\n*   **Core Nodes** can be core or app nodes. Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls. Refer to the [Core Nodes library](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/) for a full list of core nodes.\n*   **Cluster Nodes** are node groups that work together to provide functionality in a workflow. Refer to [Cluster nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/) for more information.\n\nLearn more\n\nRefer to [Node types](https://docs.n8n.io/builtin/node-types/) for a more detailed explanation of all node types.\n\n### Finding nodes[#](#finding-nodes \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can find all available nodes in the **nodes panel** on the right side of the Editor UI. There are three ways in which you can open the nodes panel:\n\n*   Click the **+** icon in the top right corner of the canvas.\n*   Click the **+** icon on the right side of an existing node on the canvas (the node to which you want to add another one).\n*   Click the Tab key on your keyboard.\n\n![Nodes panel](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/l1-c1-node-menu-drilldown.gif)\n\n_Nodes panel_\n\nIn the nodes panel, notice that when adding your first node, you will see the different trigger node categories. After you have added your trigger node, you'll see that the nodes panel changes to show Action, Data transformation, Helper, Flow and File nodes.\n\nIf you want to find a specific node, use the search input at the top of the nodes panel.\n\n### Adding nodes[#](#adding-nodes \"Permanent link\")\n\nThere are two ways to add nodes to your canvas:\n\n*   Select the node you want in the nodes panel. The new node will automatically connect to the selected node on the canvas.\n*   Drag and drop the node from the nodes panel to the canvas.\n\n### Node buttons[#](#node-buttons \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you hover on a node, you'll notice that three icons appear on top:\n\n*   Execute the node (Play icon)\n*   Deactivate/Activate the node (Power icon)\n*   Delete the node (Trash icon)\n\nAdditionally, you'll see an elipsis icon, which opens a context menu containing other [node options](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/#node-controls).\n\nMoving a workflow\n\nTo move a workflow around the canvas, select all nodes with your mouse or by selecting **Ctrl + A**, select and hold on a node, then drag it to any point you want on the canvas.\n\n## Summary[#](#summary \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn this lesson you learned how to navigate the Editor UI, what the icons mean, how to access the left-side and node panels, and how to add nodes to the canvas and interpret their execution results.\n\nIn the next lesson, you will build a mini-workflow to put into practice what you've learned so far."

The workflow consists of five steps:\n\n1.  [Add a Manual Trigger node](#1-add-a-manual-trigger-node)\n2.  [Add the Hacker News node](#2-add-the-hacker-news-node)\n3.  [Configure the Hacker News node](#3-configure-the-hacker-news-node)\n4.  [Execute the node](#4-execute-the-node)\n5.  [Save the workflow](#5-save-the-workflow)\n\n## 1\\. Add a Manual Trigger node[#](#1-add-a-manual-trigger-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nOpen the nodes panel (reminder: you can open this by selecting the **+** icon in the top right corner of the canvas or selecting Tab on your keyboard).\n\nThen:\n\n1.  Search for the **Manual Trigger** node.\n2.  Select it when it appears in the search.\n\nThis will add the Manual Trigger node to your canvas, which will allow you to run the workflow any time by selecting the **Test workflow** button.\n\nManual triggers\n\nFor faster workflow creation, you can skip this step in the future. Adding any other node without a trigger will add the Manual Trigger node to the workflow.\n\nIn a real-world scenario, you would likely want to set up a schedule or some other trigger to run the workflow.\n\n## 2\\. Add the Hacker News node[#](#2-add-the-hacker-news-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nSelect the **+** icon to the right of the Manual Trigger node to open the nodes panel.\n\nThen:\n\n1.  Search for the **Hacker News** node.\n2.  Select it when it appears in the search.\n3.  In the **Actions** section, select **Get many items**.\n\nn8n adds the node to your canvas and the node window opens to display its configuration details.\n\n## 3\\. Configure the Hacker News node[#](#3-configure-the-hacker-news-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen you add a new node to the Editor UI, the node is automatically activated.

For this example, we want to get only articles that include the keyword \"automation.\"  \n    \n\nThe configuration of the parameters for the Hacker News node should now look like this:\n\n![Hacker News node parameters](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c-2-hacker-news-node-parameters.png)\n\n_Hacker News node parameters_\n\n### Settings[#](#settings \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe **Settings** section includes several options for node design and executions. In this case, we'll configure only the final two settings, which set the node's appearance in the Editor UI canvas.\n\nIn the Hacker News node Settings, edit:\n\n*   **Notes**: Get the 10 latest articles.\n    \n    Node notes\n    \n    It's often helpful to add a short description in the node about what it does. This is especially helpful for complex or shared workflows!\n    \n*   **Display note in flow?**: toggle to true  \n    This option will display the Note under the node in the canvas.\n    \n\nThe configuration of the settings for the Hacker News node should now look like this:\n\n![Hacker News node settings](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-hacker-news-node-setting-configuration.png)\n\n_Hacker News node settings_\n\nRenaming a node\n\nYou can rename the node with a name that's more descriptive for your use case. There are three ways to do this:\n\n*   Select the node you want to rename and at the same time press the F2 key on your keyboard.\n*   Double-click on the node to open the node window. Click on the name of the node in the top left corner of the window, rename it as you like, then click **Rename** to save the node under the new name.\n*   Right-click on the node and select the **Rename** option, or select the node and press F2 on your keyboard.\n\n![Renaming a node](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-renaming-a-node-from-the-keyboard.png)\n\n_Renaming a node from the keyboard_\n\n## 4\\. Execute the node[#](#4-execute-the-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nSelect the **Test step** button in the node details window. You should see 10 results in the Output **Table** view.\n\n![Results in Table view for the Hacker News node](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-results-in-table-view-for-the-hacker-news-node.png)\n\n_Results in Table view for the Hacker News node_\n\n### Node executions[#](#node-executions \"Permanent link\")\n\nNode execution\n\nA node execution represents a run of that node to retrieve the specified data.\n\nIf a node executes successfully, a small green checkmark appears on top of the node in the canvas\n\n![Successfully executed workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-successfully-executed-workflow.png)\n\n_Successfully executed workflow_\n\nIf the parameters are configured correctly and everything works fine, the requested data displays in the node window in **Table**, **JSON**, and **Schema** format. You can switch between these views by selecting the one you want from the **Table|JSON|Schema** button at the top of the node window.\n\nTable vs JSON views\n\nThe **Table** view is the default. It displays the requested data in a table, where the rows are the records and the columns are the available attributes of those records.\n\nHere's our Hacker News output in JSON view:\n\n![Results in JSON view for the Hacker News node](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-two/l1-c2-results-in-json-view-for-the-hacker-news-node.png)\n\n_Results in JSON view for the Hacker News node_\n\nThe node window displays more information about the node execution:\n\n*   Next to the **Output** title, notice a small icon (this will be a green checkmark if the node executed successfully). If you hover on it, you'll get two more pieces of information that can provide insights into the performance of each individual node in a workflow:\n    *   **Start Time**: When the node execution started\n    *   **Execution Time**: How long it took for the node to return the results from the moment it started executing\n*   Just below the **Output** title, you'll notice another piece of information: **10 items**. This field displays the number of items (records) that the node request returned. In this example, it's expected to be 10, since this is the limit we set in step 2. But if you don't set a limit, it's useful to see how many records are actually returned.\n\nError in nodes\n\nA red warning icon on a node means that the node has errors. This might happen if the node credentials are missing or incorrect or the node parameters aren't configured correctly.\n\n![Error in nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-one/error-node.png)\n\n_Error in nodes_\n\n## 5\\. Save the workflow[#](#5-save-the-workflow \"Permanent link\")\n\nOnce you're finished editing the node, select **Back to canvas** to return to the main canvas.\n\nBy default, your workflow is automatically saved as \"My workflow.\"\n\nFor this lesson, rename the workflow to be \"Hacker News workflow.\"\n\nReminder\n\nYou can rename a workflow by clicking on the workflow's name at the top of the Editor UI.\n\nOnce you've renamed the workflow, be sure to save it.\n\nThere are two ways in which you can save a workflow:\n\n*   From the Canvas in Editor UI, click **Ctrl + S** or **Cmd + S** on your keyboard.\n*   Select the **Save** button in the top right corner of the Editor UI. You may need to leave the node editor first by clicking outside the dialog.\n\n## Summary[#](#summary \"Permanent link\")\n\nCongratulations, you just built your first workflow! In this lesson, you learned how to use actions in app nodes, configure their parameters and settings, and save and execute your workflow.\n\nIn the next lesson, you'll meet your new client, Nathan, who needs to automate his sales reporting work. You will build a more complex workflow for his use case, helping him become more productive at work."

  "markdown": "# Environments in n8n | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/source-control-environments/understand/environments.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nn8n has built its environments feature on top of Git, a version control software. This document helps you understand:\n\n*   The purpose of environments.\n*   How environments work in n8n.\n\n## Environments: What and why[#](#environments-what-and-why \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn software development, the environment is all the infrastructure and tooling around the code, including the tools that run the software, and the specific configuration of those tools. For a more detailed introduction to environments in software development, refer to [Codecademy | Environments](https://www.codecademy.com/article/environments).\n\nLow-code development in n8n is similar. n8n is where you build and run your workflows. Your instance may have particular configurations: on Cloud, n8n determines the configuration. On self-hosted instances, there are extensive [configuration options](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/). You may also have made changes to the settings of your instance. This combination of n8n and your instance's specific configuration and settings is the environment your workflows run in.\n\nThere are advantages to having more than one environment. A common pattern is to have different environments for development and production:\n\n*   Development: do work and make changes.\n*   Production: the live environment.\n\nA setup like this helps you make changes to workflows without breaking workflows that are in use.\n\n## Environments in n8n[#](#environments-in-n8n_1 \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn n8n, an environment comprises two parts, an n8n instance and a Git branch:\n\n*   The n8n instance is where you build and run workflows.\n*   The Git branch stores copies of the workflows, as well as tags, and variable and credential stubs.\n\nn8n doesn't sync credentials and variable values with Git. You must set up the credentials and variable values manually when setting up a new instance. For more information, refer to [Push and pull | What gets committed](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/using/push-pull/#what-gets-committed) and [Manage variables](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/using/manage-variables/).\n\nHow you copy work between environments depends on your branch and n8n instance configuration:\n\n*   Multiple instances, one branch: you can push from one instance to the Git branch, then pull the work to another instance.\n*   Multiple instances, multiple branches: you need to create a pull request and merge in your Git provider. For example, if you have development, test, and production branches, each linked to their own instance, you need to merge the development branch into test to make the work from the development instance available on the test instance. Refer to [Copy work between environments](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/using/copy-work/) for more information, including steps to partially automate the process.\n\nFor detailed guidance on pushing and pulling work, refer to [Push and pull](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/using/push-pull/).\n\nRefer to [Set up source control](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/setup/) to learn more about linking your n8n instance to Git, or follow the [Tutorial: Create environments with source control](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/create-environments/) to set up your environments using one of n8n's recommended configurations."

Nathan works as an Analytics Manager at ABCorp. His job is to support the ABCorp team with reporting and analytics. Being a true jack of all trades, he also handles several miscellaneous initiatives.\n\nSome things that Nathan does are repetitive and mind-numbing. He wants to automate some of these tasks so that he doesn't burn out. As an **Automation Expert**, you are meeting with Nathan today to help him understand how he can offload some of his responsibilities to n8n.\n\n## Understanding the scenario[#](#understanding-the-scenario \"Permanent link\")\n\n**You 👩‍🔧:** Nice to meet you, Nathan. Glad to be doing this! What's a repetitive task that's error-prone and that you'd like to get off your plate first?\n\n**Nathan 🙋:** Thanks for coming in! The most annoying one's gotta be the weekly sales reporting.\n\nI have to collect sales data from our legacy data warehouse, which manages data from the main business processes of an organization, such as sales or production. Now, each sales order can have the status Processing or Booked. I have to calculate the sum of all the Booked orders and announce them in the company Discord every Monday. Then I have to create a spreadsheet of all the Processing sales so that the Sales Managers can review them and check if they need to follow up with customers.\n\nThis manual work is tough and requires high attention to detail to make sure that all the numbers are right. Inevitably, I lose my focus and mistype a number or I don't get to do it on time. I've been criticized once by my manager for miscalculating the data.\n\n**You 👩‍🔧:** Oh no! Doesn't the data warehouse have a way to export the data?\n\n**Nathan 🙋:** The data warehouse was written in-house ages ago. It doesn't have a CSV export but they recently added a couple of API endpoints that expose this data, if that helps.\n\n**You 👩‍🔧:** Perfect! That's a good start. If you have a generic API, we can add some custom code and a couple of services to make an automated workflow. This gig has n8n written all over it. Let's get started!"

  "markdown": "# Git and n8n | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/source-control-environments/understand/git.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nn8n uses Git to provide source control. To use this feature, it helps to have some knowledge of basic Git concepts. n8n doesn't implement all Git functionality: you shouldn't view n8n's source control as full version control.\n\nNew to Git and source control?\n\nIf you're new to Git, don't panic. You don't need to learn Git to use n8n. This document explains the concepts you need. You do need some Git knowledge to set up the source control, as this involves work in your Git provider.\n\nFamiliar with Git and source control?\n\nIf you're familiar with Git, don't rely on behaviors matching exactly. In particular, be aware that source control in n8n doesn't support a pull request-style review and merge process, unless you do this outside n8n in your Git provider.\n\nThis page introduces the Git concepts and terminology used in n8n. It doesn't cover everything you need to set up and manage a repository. The person doing the [Setup](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/setup/) should have some familiarity with Git and with their Git hosting provider.\n\nThis is a brief introduction\n\nGit is a complex topic. This section provides a brief introduction to the key terms you need when using environments in n8n. If you want to learn about Git in depth, refer to [GitHub | Git and GitHub learning resources](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources).\n\n## Git overview[#](#git-overview \"Permanent link\")\n\n[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a tool for managing, tracking, and collaborating on multiple versions of documents. It's the basis for widely used platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/).\n\n## Branches: Multiple copies of a project[#](#branches-multiple-copies-of-a-project \"Permanent link\")\n\nGit uses branches to maintain multiple copies of a document alongside each other. Every branch has its own version. A common pattern is to have a main branch, and then everyone who wants to contribute to the project works on their own branch (copy). When they finish their work, their branch is merged back into the main branch.\n\n![Diagram](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/simple-git-branch.png)\n\n## Local and remote: Moving work between your machine and a Git provider[#](#local-and-remote-moving-work-between-your-machine-and-a-git-provider \"Permanent link\")\n\nA common pattern when using Git is to install Git on your own computer, and use a Git provider such as GitHub to work with Git in the cloud. In effect, you have a Git repository (project) on GitHub, and work with copies of it on your local machine.\n\nn8n uses this pattern for source control: you'll work with your workflows on your n8n instance, but send them to your Git provider to store them.\n\n## Push, pull, and commit[#](#push-pull-and-commit \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n uses three key Git processes:\n\n*   **Push**: send work from your instance to Git. This saves a copy of your workflows and tags, as well as credential and variable stubs, to Git. You can choose which workflows you want to save.\n*   **Pull**: get the workflows, tags, and variables from Git and load it into n8n.\n    \n    Pulling overwrites your work\n    \n    If you have made changes to a workflow in n8n, you must push the changes to Git before pulling. When you pull, it overwrites any changes you've made if they aren't stored in Git.\n    \n*   **Commit**: a commit in n8n is a single occurrence of pushing work to Git. In n8n, commit and push happen at the same time.\n    \n\nRefer to [Push and pull](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/using/push-pull/) for detailed information about how n8n interacts with Git."

Get the relevant data (order id, order status, order value, employee name) from the data warehouse\n2.  Filter the orders by their status (Processing or Booked)\n3.  Calculate the total value of all the Booked orders\n4.  Notify the team members about the Booked orders in the company's Discord channel\n5.  Insert the details about the Processing orders in Airtable for follow-up\n6.  Schedule this workflow to run every Monday morning\n\nNathan's workflow involves sending data from the company's data warehouse to two external services: - Discord - Airtable\n\nIn between, the data has to be wrangled with general functions (conditional filtering, calculation, scheduling).\n\nn8n provides integrations for all these steps, so Nathan's workflow in n8n would look like this:\n\n![Finished workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-four/l1-c4-nathans-workflow.png)\n\n_Nathan's workflow_\n\nYou will build this workflow in eight steps:\n\n1.

Owners can see all workflows, but there is no way to see who created a particular workflow, so there is a risk of overriding other people's work if you build and edit workflows as an owner.\n*   Users must be careful not to edit the same workflow simultaneously. It's possible to do it, but the users will overwrite each other's changes.\n*   To move workflows between accounts, export the workflow as JSON, then import it to the new account. Note that this action loses the workflow history.\n*   Webhook paths must be unique across the entire instance. This means each webhook path must be unique for all workflows and all users. By default, n8n generates a long random value for the webhook path, but users can edit this to their own custom path. If two users set the same path value:\n    *   The path works for the first workflow that's run or activated.\n    *   Other workflows will error if they try to run with the same path.\n\n## Self-hosted[#](#self-hosted \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you run n8n behind a reverse proxy, set the following environment variables so that n8n generates emails with the correct URL:\n\n*   `N8N_HOST`\n*   `N8N_PORT`\n*   `N8N_PROTOCOL`\n*   `N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL`\n\nMore information on these variables is available in [Environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/)."

It doesn't include changing (transforming) data, just referencing it.\n\nYou can map data in the following ways:\n\n*   Using the expressions editor.\n*   By dragging and dropping data from the **INPUT** into parameters. This generates the expression for you.\n\nFor information on errors with mapping and linking items, refer to [Item linking errors](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/).\n\n## How to drag and drop data[#](#how-to-drag-and-drop-data \"Permanent link\")\n\n1.  Run your workflow to load data.\n2.  Open the node where you need to map data.\n3.  You can map in table, JSON, and schema view:\n    *   In table view: click and hold a table heading to map top level data, or a field in the table to map nested data.\n    *   In JSON view: click and hold a key.\n    *   In schema view: click and hold a key.\n4.  Drag the item into the field where you want to use the data.\n\n### Understand what you're mapping with drag and drop[#](#understand-what-youre-mapping-with-drag-and-drop \"Permanent link\")\n\nData mapping maps the key path, and loads the key's value into the field. For example, given the following data:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `[ \t{ \t\t\"fruit\": \"apples\", \t\t\"color\": \"green\" \t} ]` |\n\nYou can map `fruit` by dragging and dropping **fruit** from the **INPUT** into the field where you want to use its value. This creates an expression, `{{ $json.fruit }}`. When the node iterates over input items, the value of the field becomes the value of `fruit` for each item.\n\n### Understand nested data[#](#understand-nested-data \"Permanent link\")\n\nGiven the following data:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16 | `[   {     \"name\": \"First item\",     \"nested\": {       \"example-number-field\": 1,       \"example-string-field\": \"apples\"     }   },   {     \"name\": \"Second item\",     \"nested\": {       \"example-number-field\": 2,       \"example-string-field\": \"oranges\"     }   } ]` |\n\nn8n displays it in table form like this:\n\n![\"Screenshot of a table in the INPUT panel.

  "markdown": "# Branch patterns | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/source-control-environments/understand/patterns.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nThe relationship between n8n instances and Git branches is flexible. You can create different setups depending on your needs.\n\nRecommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance\n\nYou can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both.\n\n## Multiple instances, multiple branches[#](#multiple-instances-multiple-branches \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis pattern involves having multiple n8n instances, each one linked to its own branch.\n\nYou can use this pattern for environments. For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them to their own branches. Push work from your development instance to its branch, do a pull request to move work to the production branch, then pull to the production instance.\n\nThe advantages of this pattern are:\n\n*   An added safety layer to prevent changes getting into your production environment by mistake. You have to do a pull request in GitHub to copy work between environments.\n*   It supports more than two instances.\n\nThe disadvantage is more manual steps to copy work between environments.\n\n![Diagram](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-multi.png)\n\n## Multiple instances, one branch[#](#multiple-instances-one-branch \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse this pattern if you want the same workflows, tags, and variables everywhere, but want to use them in different n8n instances.\n\nYou can use this pattern for environments. For example, create two n8n instances, development and production. Link them both to the same branch. Push work from development, and pull it into production.\n\nThis pattern is also useful when testing a new version of n8n: you can create a new n8n instance with the new version, connect it to the Git branch and test it, while your production instance remains on the older version until you're confident it's safe to upgrade.\n\nThe advantage of this pattern is that work is instantly available to other environments when you push from one instance.\n\nThe disadvantages are:\n\n*   If you push by mistake, there is a risk the work will make it into your production instance. If you [use a GitHub Action to automate pulls](#optional-use-a-github-action-to-automate-pulls) to production, you must either use the multi-instance, multi-branch pattern, or be careful to never push work that you don't want in production.\n*   Pushing and pulling to the same instance can cause data loss as changes are overridden when performing these actions. You should set up processes to ensure content flows in one direction.\n\n![Diagram](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-one.png)\n\n## One instance, multiple branches[#](#one-instance-multiple-branches \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe instance owner can change which Git branch connects to the instance. The full setup in this case is likely to be a [Multiple instances, multiple branches](#multiple-instances-multiple-branches) pattern, but with one instance switching between branches.\n\nThis is useful to review work. For example, different users could work on their own instance and push to their own branch. The reviewer could work in a review instance, and switch between branches to load work from different users.\n\nNo cleanup\n\nn8n doesn't clean up the existing contents of an instance when changing branches. Switching branches in this pattern results in all the workflows from each branch being in your instance.\n\n![Diagram](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/vc-one-multi.png)\n\n## One instance, one branch[#](#one-instance-one-branch \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis is the simplest pattern.\n\n![Diagram](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/vc-one-one.png)"

But not all apps or services have dedicated nodes, like the legacy data warehouse from Nathan's company.\n\nThough we can't directly export the data, Nathan told us that the data warehouse has a couple of API endpoints. That's all we need to access the data using the [HTTP Request node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) in n8n.\n\nNo node for that service?\n\nThe HTTP Request node is one of the most versatile nodes, allowing you to make HTTP requests to query data from apps and services. You can use it to access data from apps or services that don't have a dedicated node in n8n.\n\n## Add an HTTP Request node[#](#add-an-http-request-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nNow, in your Editor UI, add an HTTP Request node like you learned in the lesson [Adding nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-1/#adding-nodes). The node window will open, where you need to configure some parameters.\n\n![HTTP Request node](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-1-http-request-node.png)\n\n_HTTP Request node_\n\nThis node will use credentials.\n\nCredentials\n\nCredentials are unique pieces of information that identify a user or a service and enable them to access apps or services (in our case, represented as n8n nodes). A common form of credentials is a username and a password, but they can take other forms depending on the service.\n\nIn this case, you'll need the credentials for the ABCorp data warehouse API included in the email from n8n you received when you signed up for this course. If you haven't signed up yet, [sign up here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/PDEMrevI).\n\nIn the Parameters of the HTTP Request node, make the following adjustments:\n\n*   **Method**: This should default to GET. Make sure it's set to GET.\n*   **URL**: Add the Dataset URL you received in the email when you signed up for this course.\n*   **Send Headers**: Toggle this control to true. In **Specify Headers**, ensure **Using Fields Below** is selected.\n    *   **Header Parameters** > **Name**: Enter `unique_id`.\n    *   **Header Parameters** > **Value**: The Unique ID you received in the email when you signed up for this course.\n*   **Authentication**: Select **Generic Credential Type**. This option requires credentials to allow you to access the data.\n    *   **Generic Auth Type**: Select **Header Auth**. (This field will appear after you select the Generic Credential Type for the Authentication.)\n    *   **Credential for Header Auth**: To add your credentials, select **Create New Credential**. This will open the Credentials window.\n    *   In the Credentials window, set **Name** to be the Header Auth name you received in the email when you signed up for this course.\n    *   In the Credentials window, set **Value** to be the Header Auth value you received in the email when you signed up for this course.\n    *   Click on the **Save** button in the Credentials window to save your credentials. Your **Credentials Connection** window should look like this:\n        \n        ![HTTP Request node credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-1-http-request-node-credentials.png)\n        \n        _HTTP Request node credentials_\n        \n\nCredentials naming\n\nNew credentials are named \"_node name_ account\" by default. You can rename the credentials by clicking on the name, similarly to renaming nodes. It's good practice to give them names that identify the app/service, type, and purpose of the credential. A naming convention makes it easier to keep track of and identify your credentials.\n\n## Get the data[#](#get-the-data \"Permanent link\")\n\nSelect the **Test step** button in the HTTP Request node window. The result of the HTTP request should look like this:\n\n![HTTP Request node output](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-1-http-request-node-window.png)\n\n_HTTP Request node output_\n\nThis view should be familiar to you from the [Building a mini-workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-2/).\n\nThis is the data from ABCorp's data warehouse that Nathan needs to work with. This data set includes sales information of 30 customers with five columns:\n\n*   `orderID`: The unique id of each order.\n*   `customerID`: The unique id of each customer.\n*   `employeeName`: The name of Nathan's colleague who is responsible for the customer.\n*   `orderPrice`: The total price of the customer's order.\n*   `orderStatus`: Whether the customer's order status is booked (booked) or still in processing (processing).\n\n## What's next?[#](#whats-next \"Permanent link\")\n\n**Nathan 🙋**: This is great! You already automated an important part of my job with only one node. Now instead of manually accessing the data every time I need it, I can use the HTTP Request Node to automatically get the information.\n\n**You 👩‍🔧**: Exactly! In the next step, I'll help you one step further and insert the received data into Airtable, as you need it."

Be careful setting this on IF nodes, as it could cause an infinite loop.\n*   **Execute Once**: The node executes once, with data from the first item it receives. It doesn't process any extra items.\n*   **Retry On Fail**: When an execution fails, the node reruns until it succeeds.\n*   **On Error**:\n    *   **Stop Workflow**: Halts the entire workflow when an error occurs, preventing further node execution.\n    *   **Continue**: Proceeds to the next node despite the error, using the last valid data.\n    *   **Continue (using error output)**: Continues workflow execution, passing error information to the next node for potential handling.\n\nYou can document your workflow using node notes:\n\n*   **Notes**: Note to save with the node.\n*   **Display note in flow**: If active, n8n displays the note in the workflow as a subtitle."

For example, n8n also has a node for [**Google Sheets**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlesheets/).\n\nAfter this step, your workflow should look like this:\n\n![Workflow with the Airtable node](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-workflow-with-airtable-node.png)\n\n_Workflow with the Airtable node_\n\n## Configure your table[#](#configure-your-table \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf we're going to insert data into Airtable, we first need to set up a table there. To do this:\n\n1.  [Create an Airtable account](https://airtable.com/signup).\n2.  In your Airtable workspace add a new base from scratch and name it, for example, _beginner course_.\n    \n    ![Create an Airtable base](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-create-airtable-base.png)\n    \n    _Create an Airtable base_\n    \n3.  In the beginner course base you have by default a **Table 1** with four fields: `Name`, `Notes`, `Assignee`, and `Status`. These fields aren't relevant for us since they aren't in our orders data set. This brings us to the next point: the names of the fields in Airtable have to match the names of the columns in the node result. - Replace the four default table fields with the five column names from the data set, selecting **Number** field type for `orderID`, `customerID`, and `orderPrice`, and **Single line text** for `employeeName` and `orderStatus`. - Delete the 3 blank rows created by default. - Also, rename the table from **Table 1** to **orders** to make it easier to identify.\n    \n\nNow your table should look like this:\n\n![Orders table in Airtable](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-orders-table.png)\n\n_Orders table in Airtable_\n\nNow that the table is ready, let's return to the workflow in the n8n Editor UI.\n\n## Add an Airtable node to the HTTP Request node[#](#add-an-airtable-node-to-the-http-request-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nAdd an Airtable node connected to the HTTP Request node.\n\nRemember\n\nYou can add a node connected to an existing node by selecting the **+** icon next to the existing node.\n\nIn the node panel:\n\n1.  Search for Airtable.\n2.  Select **Create a record** from the **Record Actions** search results.\n\nThis will add the Airtable node to your canvas and open the node details window.\n\nIn the Airtable node window, configure the following parameters:\n\n*   **Credential to connect with**:\n    *   Select 'Create new credential'\n    *   Keep the default option 'Connect using: Access Token' selected\n    *   **Access token**: Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/) to create your token. Adding credentials for Airtable is similar to the HTTP Request node you configured in the previous chapter. However, the process of obtaining an API key for Airtable (and other apps/services) is different.\n*   **Resource**: Record\n*   **Operation**: Create. This operation will create the new record in the table.\n*   **Base**: You can pick your base from a list(e.g beginner course), URL or ID after authenticating. If you wish to use the Base ID, go to [Airtable's API page](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction) and find the relevant base (located at the bottom of the page). Then click the base title and you'll find the ID on that page.\n*   **Table**: orders\n*   **Mapping Column Mode**: Map automatically. In this mode, the incoming data fields are named the same as the columns in Airtable\n\n## Test the Airtable node[#](#test-the-airtable-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nOnce you've finished configuring the Airtable node, execute it by selecting **Test step**.\n\nYour results should look like this:\n\n![Airtable node results](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-airtable-node.png)\n\n_Airtable node results_\n\nAll 30 data records will now appear in the orders table in Airtable:\n\n![Imported records in the orders table](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-2-airtable-records.png)\n\n_Imported records in the orders table_\n\n## What's next?[#](#whats-next \"Permanent link\")\n\n**Nathan 🙋**: Wow, this automation is really useful! But this inserts all collected data from the HTTP Request node into Airtable.

Basically, we want to tell the program that _if_ the `orderStatus` is processing, _then_ insert all records with this status into Airtable; _else_, for example, if the `orderStatus` isn't _processing_, calculate the sum of all orders with the other `orderStatus (booked)`.\n\nThis if-then-else command is conditional logic. In n8n workflows, conditional logic can be implemented with the [If node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/), which splits a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations.\n\nIf vs. Switch\n\nIf you need to filter data on more than two conditional routes that are possible with the If node (true and false), use the [Switch node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/). The Switch node is similar to the If node, but supports multiple output routes.\n\n## Remove the connection to the Airtable node[#](#remove-the-connection-to-the-airtable-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nFirst, let's remove the connection between the HTTP Request node and the Airtable node:\n\n1.  Hover over the arrow connection the **HTTP Request** node and the **Airtable** node.\n2.  Select the trash icon to remove the connection.\n\n## Configure the If node[#](#configure-the-if-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nWith the connection to the Airtable node removed, add an If node connected to the HTTP Request node:\n\n1.  Select the **+** sign coming off the HTTP Request node.\n2.  Search for the If node.\n3.  Select it when it appears in the search.\n\nFor the If node, we'll use an expression.\n\nExpressions\n\nAn expression is a string of characters and symbols in a programming language that represents a value depending upon its input. In n8n workflows, you can use expressions in a node to refer to another node for input data. In our example, the If node references the data output by the HTTP Request node.\n\nIn the If node window, configure the parameters:\n\n*   **Value 1**: `{{ $json.orderStatus }}`\n    \n    1.  To select this value, first hover over the value1 field.\n    2.  Select the **Expression** tab on the right side of the Value 1 field.\n    3.  Next, open the expression editor by selecting the link icon:\n        \n        ![Opening the Expression Editor](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-3-if-node-open-editor.png)\n        \n        _Opening the Expression Editor_\n        \n    4.  Now use the **Variable Selector** navigation to open **Current Node** > **Input Data** > **JSON**.\n    5.

Remember what Nathan said at the end of the [Inserting data into Airtable](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.2/) lesson?\n\n> I actually need to insert only processing orders in the table...\n\nSince Nathan only needs the `processing` orders in the table, we'll connect the Airtable node to the If node's `true` connector.\n\nIn this case, since the Airtable node is already on our canvas, select the **HTTP Request** `true` connector and drag it to the Airtable node.\n\nIt's a good idea at this point to retest the Airtable node. Before you do, open your table in Airtable and delete all existing rows. Then open the Airtable node window in n8n and select **Test step**.\n\nReview your data in Airtable to be sure your workflow only added the correct orders (those with orderStatus of `processing`).\n\nAt this stage, your workflow should look like this:\n\n![Workflow with the If node](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-5-3-workflow-with-if-node.png)\n\n_Workflow with the If node_\n\n## What's next?[#](#whats-next \"Permanent link\")\n\n**Nathan 🙋**: This If node is really useful for filtering data! Now I have all the information about processing orders. I actually only need the `employeeName` and `orderID`, but I guess I can keep all the other fields just in case.\n\n**You 👩‍🔧**: Actually, I wouldn't recommend doing that. Inserting more data requires more computational power, the data transfer is slower and takes longer, and takes up more storage resources in your table. In this particular case, 14 records with 5 features might not seem like a lot to make a significant difference, but if your business grows to thousands of records and tens of features, things add up and even one extra column can affect performance.\n\n**Nathan 🙋**: Oh, that's good to know. Can you select only two fields from the processing orders?\n\n**You 👩‍🔧**: Sure, I'll do that in the next step."

Refer to [Git and n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/understand/git/) for an introduction to how n8n works with Git.\n\nRecommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance\n\nYou can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both.\n\n## Fetch other people's work[#](#fetch-other-peoples-work \"Permanent link\")\n\nRestricted to instance owners\n\nOrdinary users can't fetch work from Git.\n\nTo pull work from Git, select **Pull** ![Pull icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/pull-icon.png) in the main menu.\n\nView screenshot\n\n![Pull and push buttons when menu is closed](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/pull-push-menu-closed.png)\n\nPull and push buttons when menu is closed\n\n![Pull and push buttons when menu is open](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/pull-push-menu-open.png)\n\nPull and push buttons when menu is open\n\nn8n may display a warning about overriding local changes. Select **Pull and override** to override your local work with the content in Git.\n\n### Workflow and credential owner may change on pull[#](#workflow-and-credential-owner-may-change-on-pull \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen you pull from Git to an n8n instance, n8n tries to assign workflows and credentials to a matching user or project.\n\nIf the original owner is a user:\n\nIf the same owner is available on both instances (matching email), the owner remains the same. If the original owner isn't on the new instance, n8n sets the user performing the pull as the workflow owner.\n\nIf the original owner is a [project](https://docs.n8n.io/user-management/rbac/):\n\nn8n tries to match the original project name to a project name on the new instance. If no matching project exists, n8n creates a new project with the name, assigns the current user as project owner, and imports the workflows and credentials to the project.\n\n### Pulling may cause brief service interruption[#](#pulling-may-cause-brief-service-interruption \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you pull changes to an active workflow, n8n sets the workflow to inactive while pulling, then reactivates it. This may result in a few seconds of downtime for the workflow.\n\n## Send your work to Git[#](#send-your-work-to-git \"Permanent link\")\n\nRestricted to instance owners\n\nOrdinary users can't send work to Git.\n\nTo push work to Git:\n\n1.  Select **Push** ![Push icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/push-icon.png) in the main menu.\n    \n2.  In the **Commit and push changes** modal, select which workflows you want to push. n8n automatically pushes tags, and variable and credential stubs.\n    \n3.  Enter a commit message. This should be a one sentence description of the changes you're making.\n4.  Select **Commit and Push**. n8n sends the work to Git, and displays a success message on completion.\n\n## What gets committed[#](#what-gets-committed \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n commits the following to Git:\n\n*   Workflows, including their tags and the email address of the workflow owner. You can choose which workflows to push.\n*   Credential stubs (ID, name, type)\n*   Variable stubs (ID and name)\n*   Projects\n\nYou can programmatically [Manage variables](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/using/manage-variables/) using the n8n API.\n\nComing soon: credential support with secret managers\n\nn8n is working on support for external secret managers to handle credentials. Once this feature is complete, n8n will support linking the secret manager to multiple instances.\n\n## Merge behaviors and conflicts[#](#merge-behaviors-and-conflicts \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n's implementation of source control is opinionated. It resolves merge conflicts for credentials and variables automatically. n8n can't detect conflicts on workflows.\n\n### Workflows[#](#workflows \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou have to explicitly tell n8n what to do about workflows when pushing or pulling. The Git repository acts as the source of truth.\n\nWhen pulling, you might get warned that your local copy of a workflow differs from Git, and if you accept, your local copy would be overridden. Be careful not to lose relevant changes when pulling.\n\nWhen you push, your local workflow will override what's in Git, so make sure that you have the most up to date version or you risk overriding recent changes.\n\nTo prevent the issue described above, you should immediately push your changes to a workflow once you finish working on it. Then it's safe to pull.\n\nTo avoid losing data:\n\n*   Design your source control setup so that workflows flow in one direction. For example, make edits on a development instance, push to Git, then pull to production. Don't make edits on the production instance and push them.\n*   Don't push all workflows. Select the ones you need.\n*   Be cautious about manually editing files in the Git repository.\n\n### Credentials, variables and workflow tags[#](#credentials-variables-and-workflow-tags \"Permanent link\")\n\nCredentials and variables can't have merge issues, as n8n chooses the version to keep.\n\nOn pull:\n\n*   If the tag, variable or credential doesn't exist, n8n creates it.\n*   If the tag, variable or credential already exists, n8n doesn't update it, unless:\n    *   You set the value of a variable using the API or externally. The new value overwrites any existing value.\n    *   The credential name has changed. n8n uses the version in Git.\n    *   The name of a tag has changed. n8n updates the tag name. Be careful when renaming tags as tag names are unique and this could cause database issues when it comes to uniqueness during the pull process.\n\nOn push:\n\n*   n8n overwrites the entire variables and tags files.\n*   If a credential already exists, n8n overwrites it with the changes, but doesn't apply these changes to existing credentials on pull.\n\nManage credentials with an external secrets vault\n\nIf you need different credentials on different n8n environments, use [External secrets](https://docs.n8n.io/external-secrets/)."

  "markdown": "# Item linking in the Code node\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nUse n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. It also has implications when using the Code node. Most nodes link every output item to an input item. This creates a chain of items that you can work back along to access previous items. For a deeper conceptual overview of this topic, refer to [Item linking concepts](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts). This document focuses on practical usage examples.\n\nWhen using the Code node, there are some scenarios where you need to manually supply item linking information if you want to be able to use `$(\"<node-name>\").item` later in the workflow. All these scenarios only apply if you have more than one incoming item. n8n automatically handles item linking for single items.\n\nThese scenarios are when you:\n\n*   Add new items: the new items aren't linked to any input.\n*   Return new items.\n*   Want to manually control the item linking.\n\n[n8n's automatic item linking](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/) handles the other scenarios.\n\nTo control item linking, set `pairedItem` when returning data. For example, to link to the item at index 0:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `[ \t{ \t\t\"json\": { \t\t\t. . .  \t\t}, \t\t// The index of the input item that generated this output item \t\t\"pairedItem\": 0 \t} ]` |\n\n### `pairedItem` usage example[#](#paireditem-usage-example \"Permanent link\")\n\nTake this input data:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22 | `[   {     \"id\": \"23423532\",     \"name\": \"Jay Gatsby\"   },   {     \"id\": \"23423533\",     \"name\": \"José Arcadio Buendía\"   },   {     \"id\": \"23423534\",     \"name\": \"Max Sendak\"   },   {     \"id\": \"23423535\",     \"name\": \"Zaphod Beeblebrox\"   },   {     \"id\": \"23423536\",     \"name\": \"Edmund Pevensie\"   } ]` |\n\nAnd use it to generate new items, containing just the name, along with a new piece of data:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14 | `newItems = []; for(let i=0; i<items.length; i++){   newItems.push(     {     \"json\":       {         \"name\": items[i].json.name, \t\t\t\t\"aBrandNewField\": \"New data for item \" + i       }     }   ) }  return newItems;` |\n\n`newItems` is an array of items with no `pairedItem`. This means there's no way to trace back from these items to the items used to generate them.\n\nAdd the `pairedItem` object:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14 | `newItems = []; for(let i=0; i<items.length; i++){   newItems.push(     {       \"json\":         {           \"name\": items[i].json.name, \t\t\t\t\t\"aBrandNewField\": \"New data for item \" + i         },       \"pairedItem\": i     }       ) } return newItems;` |\n\nEach new item now links to the item used to create it."

Push work from one instance to the Git branch.\n2.  Log in to the other instance to pull the work from Git. You can [automate pulls](#automatically-send-changes-to-n8n).\n\n## Multiple branches[#](#multiple-branches \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you have more than one Git branch, you need to merge the branches in your Git provider to copy work between environments. You can't copy work directly between environments in n8n.\n\nA common pattern is:\n\n1.  Do work in your developments instance.\n2.  Push the work to the development branch in Git.\n3.  Merge your development branch into your production branch. Refer to the documentation for your Git provider for guidance on doing this:\n    *   [GitHub: Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)\n    *   [GitLab: Creating merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html)\n    *   [Git: Basic branching and merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)\n4.  In your production n8n instance, pull the changes. You can [automate pulls](#automatically-send-changes-to-n8n).\n\n## Automatically send changes to n8n[#](#automatically-send-changes-to-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can automate parts of the process of copying work, using the `/source-control/pull` API endpoint. Call the API after merging the changes:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `curl --request POST \\ \t--location '<YOUR-INSTANCE-URL>/api/v1/source-control/pull' \\ \t--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ \t--header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <YOUR-API-KEY>' \\ \t--data '{\"force\": true}'` |\n\nThis means you can use a GitHub Action or GitLab CI/CD to automatically pull changes to the production instance on merge.\n\nA GitHub Action example:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16 | `name: CI on:   # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request events for the \"production\" branch   push:     branches: [ \"production\" ]   # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab   workflow_dispatch: jobs:   run-pull:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:       - name: PULL \t\t\t\t# Use GitHub secrets to protect sensitive information         run: >           curl --location '${{ secrets.INSTANCE_URL }}/version-control/pull' --header           'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: ${{ secrets.INSTANCE_API_KEY }}'` |"

Set up SAML with your IdP (identity provider). You need the redirect URL and entity ID. You may also need an email address and name for the IdP user.\n4.  After completing setup in your IdP, load the metadata XML into n8n. You can use a metadata URL or raw XML:\n    1.  **Metadata URL**: Copy the metadata URL from your IdP into the **Identity Provider Settings** field in n8n.\n    2.  **Raw XML**: Download the metadata XML from your IdP, toggle **Identiy Provider Settings** to **XML**, then copy the raw XML into **Identity Provider Settings**.\n5.

This doesn't have to be the node just before: it can be any previous node in the chain. When referencing nodes further back, you use the expression syntax `$(node_name).item`.\n\n![A diagram showing the threads linking multiple items back through a workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-multiple-lines.png)\n\nDiagram of threads for different items. Due to the item linking, you can get the actor for each movie using `$('Get famous movie actors').item`.\n\nSince the previous node can have multiple items in it, n8n needs to know which one to use. When using `.item`, n8n figures this out for you behind the scenes. Refer to [Item linking concepts](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/) for detailed information on how this works.\n\n`.item` fails if information is missing. To figure out which item to use, n8n maintains a thread back through the workflow's nodes for each item. For a given item, this thread tells n8n which items in previous nodes generated it. To find the matching item in a given previous node, n8n follows this thread back until it reaches the node in question.\n\nWhen using `.item`, n8n displays an error when:\n\n*   The thread is broken\n*   The thread points to more than one item in the previous node (as it's unclear which one to use)\n\nTo solve these errors, you can either avoid using `.item`, or fix the root cause.\n\nYou can avoid `.item` by using `.first()`, `.last()` or `.all()[index]` instead. They require you to know the position of the item that you’re targeting within the target node's output items. Refer to [Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/output-other-nodes/) for more detail on these methods.\n\nThe fix for the root cause depends on the exact error.\n\n### Fix for 'Info for expressions missing from previous node'[#](#fix-for-info-for-expressions-missing-from-previous-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you see this error message:\n\n> ERROR: Info for expression missing from previous node\n\nThere's a node in the chain that doesn't return pairing information. The solution here depends on the type of the previous node:\n\n*   Code nodes: make sure you return which input items the node used to produce each output item. Refer to [Item linking in the code node](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node/) for more information.\n*   Custom or community nodes: the node creator needs to update the node to return which input items it uses to produce each output item. Refer to [Item linking for node creators](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-node-building/) for more information.\n\n### Fix for 'Multiple matching items for expression'[#](#fix-for-multiple-matching-items-for-expression \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis is the error message:\n\n> ERROR: Multiple matching items for expression\n\nSometimes n8n uses multiple items to create a single item. Examples include the Summarize, Aggregate, and Merge nodes. These nodes can combine information from multiple items.\n\nWhen you use `.item` and there are multiple possible matches, n8n doesn't know which one to use. To solve this you can either:\n\n*   Use `.first()`, `.last()` or `.all()[index]` instead. Refer to [Built in methods and variables | Output of other nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/output-other-nodes/) for more detail on these methods.\n*   Reference a different node that contains the same information, but doesn't have multiple matching items."

  "markdown": "# Tutorial - Create environments with source control\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/source-control-environments/create-environments.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nFeature availability\n\n*   Available on Enterprise.\n*   You need access to the n8n instance owner account or an admin account to set up source control, and to send work to and from Git.\n\nThis tutorial walks through the process of setting up environments end-to-end. You'll create two environments: development and production. It uses GitHub as the Git provider. The process is similar for other providers.\n\nn8n has built its environments feature on top of Git, a version control software. You link an n8n instance to a Git branch, and use a push-pull pattern to move work between environments. You should have some understanding of environments and Git. If you need more information on these topics, refer to:\n\n*   [Environments in n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/understand/environments/): the purpose of environments, and how they work in n8n.\n*   [Git and n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/understand/git/): Git concepts and source control in n8n.\n\n## Choose your source control pattern[#](#choose-your-source-control-pattern \"Permanent link\")\n\nBefore setting up source control and environments, you need to plan your environments, and how they relate to Git branches. n8n supports different [Branch patterns](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/understand/patterns/). For environments, you need to choose between two patterns: multi-instance, multi-branch, or multi-instance, single-branch. This tutorial covers both patterns.\n\nRecommendation: don't push and pull to the same n8n instance\n\nYou can push work from an instance to a branch, and pull to the same instance. n8n doesn't recommend this. To reduce the risk of merge conflicts and overwriting work, try to create a process where work goes in one direction: either to Git, or from Git, but not both.\n\n### Multiple instances, multiple branches[#](#multiple-instances-multiple-branches \"Permanent link\")\n\n![Diagram](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-multi.png)\n\nThe advantages of this pattern are:\n\n*   An added safety layer to prevent changes getting into your production environment by mistake. You have to do a pull request in GitHub to copy work between environments.\n*   It supports more than two instances.\n\nThe disadvantage is more manual steps to copy work between environments.\n\n### Multiple instances, one branch[#](#multiple-instances-one-branch \"Permanent link\")\n\n![Diagram](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/vc-multi-one.png)\n\nThe advantage of this pattern is that work is instantly available to other environments when you push from one instance.\n\nThe disadvantages are:\n\n*   If you push by mistake, there is a risk the work will make it into your production instance. If you [use a GitHub Action to automate pulls](#optional-use-a-github-action-to-automate-pulls) to production, you must either use the multi-instance, multi-branch pattern, or be careful to never push work that you don't want in production.\n*   Pushing and pulling to the same instance can cause data loss as changes are overridden when performing these actions. You should set up processes to ensure content flows in one direction.\n\n## Set up your repository[#](#set-up-your-repository \"Permanent link\")\n\nOnce you've chosen your pattern, you need to set up your GitHub repository.\n\nMulti-branchSingle-branch\n\n1.  [Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).\n    *   Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.\n    *   Create the new repository with a README so you can immediately create branches.\n2.  Create one branch named `production` and another named `development`. Refer to [Creating and deleting branches within your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) for guidance.\n\n[Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).\n\n*   Make sure the repository is private, unless you want your workflows, tags, and variable and credential stubs exposed to the internet.\n*   Create the new repository with a README. This creates the `main` branch, which you'll connect to.\n\n## Connect your n8n instances to your repository[#](#connect-your-n8n-instances-to-your-repository \"Permanent link\")\n\nCreate two n8n instances, one for development, one for production.\n\n### Configure Git in n8n[#](#configure-git-in-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\n1.  Go to **Settings** > **Environments**.\n2.  In **Git repository URL** enter the SSH URL for your repository.\n3.  n8n supports ED25519 and RSA public key algorithms. ED25519 is the default. Select **RSA** under **SSH Key** if your git host requires RSA.\n4.  Copy the SSH key.\n\n### Set up a deploy key[#](#set-up-a-deploy-key \"Permanent link\")\n\nSet up SSH access by creating a deploy key for the repository using the SSH key from n8n. The key must have write access. Refer to [GitHub | Managing deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys) for guidance.\n\n### Connect n8n and configure your instance[#](#connect-n8n-and-configure-your-instance \"Permanent link\")\n\nMulti-branchSingle-branch\n\n1.  In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**. n8n connects to your Git repository.\n2.  Under **Instance settings**, choose which branch you want to use for the current n8n instance. Connect the production branch to the production instance, and the development branch to the development instance.\n3.  Production instance only: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance.\n4.  Select **Save settings**.\n\n1.  In **Settings** > **Environments** in n8n, select **Connect**.\n2.  Under **Instance settings**, select the main branch.\n3.  Production instance only: select **Protected instance** to prevent users editing workflows in this instance.\n4.  Select **Save settings**.\n\n## Push work from development[#](#push-work-from-development \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn your development instance, create a few workflows, tags, variables, and credentials.\n\nTo push work to Git:\n\n1.  Select **Push** ![Push icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/push-icon.png) in the main menu.\n    \n2.  In the **Commit and push changes** modal, select which workflows you want to push. n8n automatically pushes tags, and variable and credential stubs.\n    \n3.  Enter a commit message. This should be a one sentence description of the changes you're making.\n4.  Select **Commit and Push**. n8n sends the work to Git, and displays a success message on completion.\n\n## Pull work to production[#](#pull-work-to-production \"Permanent link\")\n\nYour work is now in GitHub. If you're using a multi-branch setup, it's on the development branch. If you chose the single-branch setup, it's on main.\n\nMulti-branchSingle-branch\n\n1.  In GitHub, create a pull request to merge development into production.\n2.  Merge the pull request.\n3.  In your production instance, select **Pull** ![Pull icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/pull-icon.png) in the main menu.\n\nIn your production instance, select **Pull** ![Pull icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/pull-icon.png) in the main menu.\n\nView screenshot\n\n![Pull and push buttons when menu is closed](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/pull-push-menu-closed.png)\n\nPull and push buttons when menu is closed\n\n![Pull and push buttons when menu is open](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/source-control-environments/pull-push-menu-open.png)\n\nPull and push buttons when menu is open\n\n### Optional: Use a GitHub Action to automate pulls[#](#optional-use-a-github-action-to-automate-pulls \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you want to avoid logging in to your production instance to pull, you can use a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions) and the [n8n API](https://docs.n8n.io/api/) to automatically pull every time you push new work to your production or main branch.\n\nA GitHub Action example:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16 | `name: CI on:   # Trigger the workflow on push or pull request events for the \"production\" branch   push:     branches: [ \"production\" ]   # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab   workflow_dispatch: jobs:   run-pull:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:       - name: PULL \t\t\t\t# Use GitHub secrets to protect sensitive information         run: >           curl --location '${{ secrets.INSTANCE_URL }}/version-control/pull' --header           'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: ${{ secrets.INSTANCE_API_KEY }}'` |\n\n## Next steps[#](#next-steps \"Permanent link\")\n\nLearn more about:\n\n*   [Environments in n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/understand/environments/) and [Git and n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/understand/git/)\n*   [Source control patterns](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/understand/patterns/)\n*   Reusable [Variables](https://docs.n8n.io/code/variables/) and [Managing variables using the API](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/using/manage-variables/) when using source control."

If you're using declarative style, n8n handles paired items for you automatically.\n\nUse n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. n8n needs to know which input item a given output item comes from. If this information is missing, expressions in other nodes may break. As a node developer, you must ensure any items returned by your node support this.\n\nThis applies to programmatic nodes (including trigger nodes). You don't need to consider item linking when building a declarative-style node. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/) for more information on node styles.\n\nStart by reading [Item linking concepts](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/), which provides a conceptual overview of item linking, and details of the scenarios where n8n can handle the linking automatically.\n\nIf you need to handle item linking manually, do this by setting `pairedItem` on each item your node returns:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20 | `// Use the pairedItem information of the incoming item newItem = { \t\"json\": { . . . }, \t\"pairedItem\": { \t\t\"item\": item.pairedItem, \t\t// Optional: choose the input to use \t\t// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs \t\t\"input\": 0 };  // Or set the index manually newItem = { \t\t\"json\": { . . . } \t\t\"pairedItem\": { \t\t\t\"item\": i, \t\t\t// Optional: choose the input to use \t\t\t// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs \t\t\t\"input\": 0 \t\t}, };` |"

In the field where you want to use a secret, enter an expression referencing the secret name:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `{{ $secrets.<vault-name>.<secret-name> }}` |\n    \n    `<vault-name>` is either `vault` (for HashiCorp) or `infisical` or `awsSecretsManager`. Replace `<secret-name>` with the name as it appears in your vault.\n\n## Using external secrets with n8n environments[#](#using-external-secrets-with-n8n-environments \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n's [Source control and environments](https://docs.n8n.io/source-control-environments/) feature allows you to create different n8n environments, backed by Git. The feature doesn't support using different credentials in different instances. You can use an external secrets vault to provide different credentials for different environments by connecting each n8n instance to a different vault or project environment.\n\nFor example, you have two n8n instances, one for development and one for production. You use Infisical for your vault. In Infisical, create a project with two environments, development and production. Generate a token for each Infisical environment. Use the token for the development environment to connect your development n8n instance, and the token for your production environment to connect your production n8n instance.\n\n## Using external secrets in projects[#](#using-external-secrets-in-projects \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo use external secrets in an [RBAC project](https://docs.n8n.io/user-management/rbac/), you must have an [instance owner or instance admin](https://docs.n8n.io/user-management/account-types/) as a member of the project.\n\n## Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting \"Permanent link\")\n\n### Infisical version changes[#](#infisical-version-changes \"Permanent link\")\n\nInfisical version upgrades can introduce problems connecting to n8n. If your Infisical connection stops working, check if there was a recent version change. If so, report the issue to help@n8n.io.\n\n### Only set external secrets on credentials owned by an instance owner or admin[#](#only-set-external-secrets-on-credentials-owned-by-an-instance-owner-or-admin \"Permanent link\")\n\nDue to the permissions that instance owners and admins have, it's possible for owners and admins to update credentials owned by another user with a secrets expression. This will appear to work in preview for an instance owner or admin, but the secret won't resolve when the workflow runs in production.\n\nOnly use external secrets for credentials that are owned by an instance admin or owner. This ensures they resolve correctly in production."

This creates a chain of items that you can work back along to access previous items. This can be complicated to understand, especially if the node splits or merges data. You need to understand item linking when building your own programmatic nodes, or in some scenarios using the Code node.\n\nThis document provides a conceptual overview of this feature. For usage details, refer to:\n\n*   [Item linking for node creators](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-node-building/), for details on how to handle item linking when building a node.\n*   [Item linking in the Code node](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node/), to learn how to handle item linking in the Code node.\n*   [Item linking errors](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/), to understand the errors you may encounter in the editor UI.\n\n## n8n's automatic item linking[#](#n8ns-automatic-item-linking \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf a node doesn't control how to link input items to output items, n8n tries to guess how to link the items automatically:\n\n*   Single input, single output: the output links to the input.\n*   Single input, multiple outputs: all outputs link to that input.\n*   Multiple inputs and outputs:\n    *   If you keep the input items, but change the order (or remove some but keep others), n8n can automatically add the correct linked item information.\n    *   If the number of inputs and outputs is equal, n8n links the items in order. This means that output-1 links to input-1, output-2 to input-2, and so on.\n    *   If the number isn't equal, or you create completely new items, n8n can't automatically link items.\n\nIf n8n can't link items automatically, and the node doesn't handle the item linking, n8n displays an error. Refer to [Item linking errors](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/) for more information.\n\n## Item linking example[#](#item-linking-example \"Permanent link\")\n\n[![A diagram showing the threads linking multiple items back through a workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-multiple-lines.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-multiple-lines.png)\n\nIn this example, it's possible for n8n to link an item in one node back several steps, despite the item order changing. This means the node that sorts movies alphabetically can access information about the linked item in the node that gets famous movie actors.\n\nThe methods for accessing linked items are different depending on whether you're using the UI, expressions, or the code node. Explore the following resources:\n\n*   [Mapping in the UI](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-mapping-ui/)\n*   [Mapping in the expressions editor](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-mapping-expressions/)\n*   [Item linking in the Code node](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-code-node/)\n*   [Item linking errors](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-errors/)"

This node is crucial in workflows which expect incoming data from previous nodes, such as when inserting values into spreadsheets or databases.\n\n## Disconnect the Airtable node[#](#disconnect-the-airtable-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn your workflow, disconnect the Airtable node **from the** If node in the same way we disconnected it in the [Filtering Orders](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.3/) lesson.\n\n## Configure the Edit Fields node[#](#configure-the-edit-fields-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nNow add a new Edit Fields (Set) node **attached to the** If node's `true` connector by selecting the **+** icon with that connector and searching for **Edit Fields**.\n\nWith the Edit Fields node window open, configure these parameters:\n\n*   Ensure **Mode** is set to **Manual Mapping**.\n*   While you can use the **Expression editor** we used in the [Filtering Orders](https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.3/) lesson, this time, let's drag the fields from the **Input** into the **Fields to Set**:\n    *   Drag **orderID** as the first field.\n    *   Drag **employeeName** as the second field.\n*   Ensure that **Include Other Input Fields** is set to false.\n\nSelect **Test step**.

With the new table created, update the Airtable node configuration to point to this new `processingOrders` table instead of the `orders` table.\n6.  Connect the Edit Fields node **connector to the** Airtable node.\n7.  Test your Airtable node to be sure it inserts records into the new `processingOrders` table.\n\nAt this stage, your workflow should now look like this:\n\n[![Workflow with the Edit Fields node](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-4-workflow-with-set-node.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/courses/level-one/chapter-five/l1-c5-4-workflow-with-set-node.png)\n\n_Workflow with the Edit Fields node_\n\n## What's next?[#](#whats-next \"Permanent link\")\n\n**Nathan 🙋**: You've already automated half of my work!

  "markdown": "# Privacy | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/privacy-security/privacy.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nThis page describes n8n's data privacy practices.\n\n### Data processing agreement[#](#data-processing-agreement \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor Cloud versions of n8n, n8n is considered both a Controller and a Processor as defined by the GDPR. As a Processor, n8n implements policies and practices that secure the personal data you send to the platform, and includes a [Data Processing Agreement](https://n8n.io/legal/#data) as part of the company's standard [Terms of Service](https://n8n.io/legal/#terms).\n\nThe n8n Data Processing Agreement includes the [Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en). These clarify how n8n handles your data, and they update n8n's GDPR policies to cover the latest standards set by the European Commission.\n\nYou can find a list of n8n sub-processors [here](https://n8n.io/legal/#subprocessors).\n\nSelf-hosted n8n\n\nFor self-hosted versions, n8n is neither a Controller nor a Processor, as we don't manage your data\n\nEmail privacy@n8n.io to request data deletion.\n\n### Sub-processors[#](#sub-processors \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis is a list of sub-processors authorized to process customer data for n8n's service. n8n audits each sub-processor's security controls and applicable regulations for the protection of personal data.\n\n| Sub-processor name | Contact details | Geographic location of processing |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Microsoft Azure | Microsoft Azure  <br>1 Microsoft Way  <br>Redmond  <br>WA 98052  <br>USA  <br>Contact information: https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-GB/privacystatement#mainhowtocontactusmodule | Germany (West Central Region) |\n| Hetzner Online | Hetzner Online GmbH  <br>Industriestr. 25  <br>91710 Gunzenhausen  <br>Germany  <br>data-protection@hetzner.com | Germany |\n\nSubscribe [here](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/FdeRxSkH?typeform-source=n8n.io) to receive updates when n8n adds or changes a sub-processor.\n\nIf you self-host n8n, you are responsible for deleting user data. If you need to delete data on behalf of one of your users, you can delete the respective execution. n8n recommends configuring n8n to prune execution data automatically every few days to avoid effortful GDPR request handling as much as possible. Configure this using the `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE` environment variable. Refer to [Environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for more information.\n\n## Data collection[#](#data-collection \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n collects selected usage and performance data to help diagnose problems and improve the platform. Read about how n8n stores and processes this information in the [privacy policy](https://n8n.io/legal/#privacy).\n\nThe data gathered is different in self-hosted n8n and n8n Cloud.\n\n### Data collection in self-hosted n8n[#](#data-collection-in-self-hosted-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n takes care to keep self-hosted data anonymous and avoids collecting sensitive data.\n\n#### What n8n collects[#](#what-n8n-collects \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   Error codes and messages of failed executions (excluding any payload data, and not for custom nodes)\n*   Error reports for app crashes and API issues\n*   The graph of a workflow (types of nodes used and how they're connected)\n*   From node parameters:\n    *   The 'resource' and 'operation' that a node is set to (if applicable)\n    *   For HTTP request nodes, the domain, path, and method (with personal data anonymized)\n*   Data around workflow executions:\n    *   Status\n    *   The user ID of the user who ran the execution\n    *   The first time a workflow loads data from an external source\n    *   The first successful production (non-manual) workflow execution\n*   The domain of webhook calls, if specified (excluding subdomain).\n*   Details on how the UI is used (for example, navigation, nodes panel searches)\n*   Diagnostic information:\n    *   n8n version\n    *   Selected settings:\n        *   DB\\_TYPE\n        *   N8N\\_VERSION\\_NOTIFICATIONS\\_ENABLED\n        *   N8N\\_DISABLE\\_PRODUCTION\\_MAIN\\_PROCESS\n        *   [Execution variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/executions)\n    *   OS, RAM, and CPUs\n    *   Anonymous instance ID\n*   IP address\n\n#### What n8n doesn't collect[#](#what-n8n-doesnt-collect \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n doesn't collect private or sensitive information, such as:\n\n*   Personally identifiable information (except IP address)\n*   Credential information\n*   Node parameters (except 'resource' and 'operation')\n*   Execution data\n*   Sensitive settings (for example, endpoints, ports, DB connections, username/password)\n*   Error payloads\n\n#### How collection works[#](#how-collection-works \"Permanent link\")\n\nMost data is sent to n8n as events that generate it occur. Workflow execution counts and an instance pulse are sent periodically (every 6 hours).\n\n#### Opting out of telemetry[#](#opting-out-of-telemetry \"Permanent link\")\n\nTelemetry collection is enabled by default. To disable it you can configure the following environment variables.\n\nTo opt out of telemetry events:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `export N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false` |\n\nTo opt out of checking for new versions of n8n:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `export N8N_VERSION_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false` |\n\nSee [configuration](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) for more info on how to set environment variables.\n\n### Data collection in n8n Cloud[#](#data-collection-in-n8n-cloud \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n Cloud collects everything listed in [Data collection in self-hosted n8n](#data-collection-in-self-hosted-n8n).\n\nAdditionally, in n8n Cloud, n8n uses [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) to track events and visualise usage, including using session recordings. Session recordings comprise the data seen by a user on screen, with the exception of credential values. n8n's product team uses this data to improve the product. All recordings are deleted after 21 days.\n\n### AI in n8n[#](#ai-in-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo provide enhanced assistance, n8n integrates AI-powered features that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\n#### How n8n uses AI[#](#how-n8n-uses-ai \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo assist and improve user experience, n8n may send specific context data to LLMs. This context data is strictly limited to information about the current workflow. n8n does not send any values from credential fields or actual output data to AI services. The data will not be incorporated, used, or retained to train the models of the AI services. Any data will be deleted after 30 days.\n\n#### When n8n shares data[#](#when-n8n-shares-data \"Permanent link\")\n\nData is only sent to AI services if workspaces have opted in to use the assistant. The Assistant is enabled by default for n8n Cloud users. When a workspace opts in to use the assistant, node-specific data is transmitted only during direct interactions and active sessions with the AI assistant, ensuring no unnecessary data sharing occurs.\n\n#### What n8n shares[#](#what-n8n-shares \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **General Workflow Information**: This includes details about which nodes are present in your workflow, the number of items currently in the workflow, and whether the workflow is active.\n*   **Input & Output Schemas of Nodes**: This includes the schema of all nodes with incoming data and the output schema of a node in question. We do not send the actual data value of the schema.\n*   **Node Configuration**: This includes the operations, options, and settings chosen in the referenced node.\n*   **Code and Expressions**: This includes any code or expressions in the node in question to help with debugging potential issues and optimizations.\n\n*   **Credentials**: Any values of the credential fields of your nodes.\n*   **Output Data**: The actual data processed by your workflows.\n*   **Sensitive Information**: Any personally identifiable information or other sensitive data that could compromise your privacy or security that you have not explicitly mentioned in node parameters or your code of a [Code Node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).\n\n### Documentation telemetry[#](#documentation-telemetry \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n's documentation (this website) uses cookies to recognize your repeated visits and preferences, as well as to measure the effectiveness of n8n's documentation and whether users find what they're searching for. With your consent, you're helping n8n to make our documentation better.\n\n[Change cookie settings](#__consent)\n\n## Retention and deletion of personal identifiable data[#](#retention-and-deletion-of-personal-identifiable-data \"Permanent link\")\n\nPID (personal identifiable data) is data that's personal to you and would identify you as an individual.\n\n### n8n Cloud[#](#n8n-cloud \"Permanent link\")\n\n#### PID retention[#](#pid-retention \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n only retains data for as long as necessary to provide the core service.\n\nFor n8n Cloud, n8n stores your workflow code, credentials, and other data indefinitely, until you choose to delete it or close your account. The platform stores execution data according to the retention rules on your account.\n\nn8n deletes most internal application logs and logs tied to subprocessors within 90 days. The company retains a subset of logs for longer periods where required for security investigations.\n\n#### PID deletion[#](#pid-deletion \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you choose to delete your n8n account, n8n deletes all customer data and event data associated with your account. n8n deletes customer data in backups within 90 days.\n\n### Self-hosted[#](#self-hosted \"Permanent link\")\n\nSelf-hosted users should have their own PID policy and data deletion processes. Refer to [What you can do](https://docs.n8n.io/privacy-security/what-you-can-do/) for more information.\n\n## Payment processor[#](#payment-processor \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n uses Paddle.com to process payments. When you sign up for a paid plan, Paddle transmits and stores the details of your payment method according to their security policy. n8n stores no information about your payment method."

This enhancement moves JavaScript code execution to a separate process, improving your workflow execution speed while adding better isolation.\n\n![Task runners overview](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/hosting/configuration/task-runner-concept.png)\n\nTask runners overview\n\nOur benchmarks show up to 6x improvement in workflow executions using Code nodes - from approximately 6 to 35 executions per second. All these improvements happen under the hood, keeping your Code node experience exactly the same.\n\nThe Task runner comes in two modes:\n\n*   Internal mode (default): Perfect for getting started, automatically managing task runners as child processes\n*   External mode: For advanced hosting scenarios requiring maximum isolation and security\n\nCurrently, this feature is opt-in and can be enabled using [environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners/). Once stable, it will become the default execution method for Code nodes.\n\nTo start using Task runners today, [check out the docs](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/task-runners/).\n\n### Node updates[#](#node-updates_3 \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   [AI Transform node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aitransform/): We improved the prompt for code generation to transform data\n*   [Code node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/): We added a warning if `pairedItem` is absent or could not be auto mapped\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.70.2[#](#n8n1702 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.70.1...n8n@1.70.2) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-12-04\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.70.1[#](#n8n1701 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.70.0...n8n@1.70.1) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-11-29\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.70.0[#](#n8n1700 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.69.0...n8n@1.70.0) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-11-27\n\nThis release contains node updates, performance improvements and bug fixes.\n\n### New canvas in beta[#](#new-canvas-in-beta \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe new canvas is now the default setting for all users.

Start the workflow with a [n8n Form Trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/).\n\n![A multi-page form with branching](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/example_image.png)\n\nA multi-page form with branching\n\nAdditionally you can:\n\n*   Set default selections with query parameters\n*   Define the form with a JSON array of objects\n*   Show a completion screen and redirect to another URL\n\n### Node updates[#](#node-updates_6 \"Permanent link\")\n\nNew nodes:\n\n*   [Google Business Profile](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebusinessprofile/) and [Google Business Profile Trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebusinessprofiletrigger/): Use these to integrate Google Business Profile reviews and posts with your workflows\n\nEnhanced nodes:\n\n*   [AI Agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/): Removed the requirement to add at least one tool\n*   [GitHub](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.github/): Added workflows as a resource operation\n*   [Structured Output Parser](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.outputparserstructured/): Added more user-friendly error messages\n\nFor additional security, we improved how we handle multi-factor authentication, hardened config file permissions and introduced JWT for the public API.\n\nFor better performance, we improved how partial executions are handled in loops.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n### Contributors[#](#contributors_4 \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   [Idan Fishman](https://github.com/idanfishman)\n\n## n8n@1.64.2[#](#n8n1642 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.64.1...n8n@1.64.2) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-10-24\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.64.1[#](#n8n1641 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.64.0...n8n@1.64.1) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-10-21\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.64.0[#](#n8n1640 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.63.4...n8n@1.64.0) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-10-16\n\nThis release contains a new node, node enhancements, performance improvements and bug fixes.\n\n### Enhanced node: Remove Duplicates[#](#enhanced-node-remove-duplicates \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe [Remove Duplicates node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/) got a major makeover with the addition of two new operations:\n\n*   Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates\n*   Clear Deduplication History: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.\n\nThis makes it easier to only process new items from any data source. For example, you can now more easily poll a Google sheet for new entries by `id` or remove duplicate orders from the same customer by comparing their `order date`. The great thing is, you can now do this within **and across** workflow runs.\n\n### New node: Gong[#](#new-node-gong \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe new node for [Gong](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gong/) allows you to get users and calls to process them further in n8n. Very useful for sales related workflows.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n### Contributors[#](#contributors_5 \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   [Sören Uhrbach](https://github.com/soerenuhrbach)\n\n## n8n@1.63.4[#](#n8n1634 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.63.3...n8n@1.63.4) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-10-15\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.62.6[#](#n8n1626 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.62.5...n8n@1.62.6) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-10-15\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.63.3[#](#n8n1633 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.63.2...n8n@1.63.3) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-10-15\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.63.2[#](#n8n1632 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.63.1...n8n@1.63.2) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-10-11\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.62.5[#](#n8n1625 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.62.4...n8n@1.62.5) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-10-11\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.63.1[#](#n8n1631 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.63.0...n8n@1.63.1) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-10-11\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.62.4[#](#n8n1624 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.62.3...n8n@1.62.4) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-10-11\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.63.0[#](#n8n1630 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.62.3...n8n@1.63.0) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-10-09\n\n[Breaking change](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md)\n\nWhat changed?\n\n*   The worker server used to bind to IPv6 by default. It now binds to IPv4 by default.\n*   The worker server's `/healthz` used to report healthy status based on database and Redis checks. It now reports healthy status regardless of database and Redis status, and the database and Redis checks are part of `/healthz/readiness`.\n\nWhen is action necessary?\n\n*   If you experience a port conflict error when starting a worker server using its default port, set a different port for the worker server with `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_PORT`.\n*   If you are relying on database and Redis checks for worker health status, switch to checking `/healthz/readiness` instead of `/healthz`.\n\nThis release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.\n\n### Node updates[#](#node-updates_7 \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   [OpenAI](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/): Added the option to choose between the default memory connector to provide memory to the assistant or to specify a thread ID\n*   [Gmail](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/) and [Slack](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/): Added custom approval operations to have a human in the loop of a workflow\n\nWe have also optimized the [worker health checks](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/logging-monitoring/monitoring/) (see breaking change above).\n\nEach credential now has a seperate url you can link to. This makes sharing much easier.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n### Contributors[#](#contributors_6 \"Permanent link\")\n\n[Pemontto](https://github.com/pemontto)\n\n## n8n@1.62.3[#](#n8n1623 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.62.2...n8n@1.62.3) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-10-08\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.62.2[#](#n8n1622 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.62.1...n8n@1.62.2) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-10-07\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.62.1[#](#n8n1621 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.61.0...n8n@1.62.1) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-10-02\n\nThis release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.\n\nSkipped 1.62.0\n\nWe skipped 1.62.0 and went straight to 1.62.1 with an additional fix.\n\n#### Additional nodes as tools[#](#additional-nodes-as-tools \"Permanent link\")\n\nAdditionally, we have added a `$fromAI()` placeholder function to use with tools, allowing you to dynamically pass information from the models to the connected tools. This function works similarly to placeholders used elsewhere in n8n.\n\nBoth of these new features enable you to build even more powerful AI agents by drawing directly from the apps your business uses. This makes integrating LLMs into your business processes even easier than before.\n\n### Node updates[#](#node-updates_8 \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   [Google BigQuery](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.googlebigquery/): Added option to return numeric values as integers and not strings\n*   [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/): Added credential support for Sysdig\n*   [Invoice Ninja](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.invoiceninja/): Additional query params for getAll requests\n*   [Question and Answer Chain](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/): Added the option to use a custom prompt\n\nDrag and drop insertion on cursor position from schema view is now also enabled for code, SQL and Html fields in nodes.\n\nCustomers with an enterprise license can now rate, tag and highlight execution data in the executions view. To use highlighting, add an [Execution Data Node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executiondata/) (or Code node) to the workflow to set [custom executions data](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/).\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n### Contributors[#](#contributors_7 \"Permanent link\")\n\n[Benjamin Roedell](https://github.com/benrobot)  \n[CodeShakingSheep](https://github.com/CodeShakingSheep)  \n[manuelbcd](https://github.com/manuelbcd)  \n[Miguel Prytoluk](https://github.com/mprytoluk)\n\n## n8n@1.61.0[#](#n8n1610 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.60.1...n8n@1.61.0) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-09-25\n\nThis release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.\n\n### Node updates[#](#node-updates_9 \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   [Brandfetch](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.brandfetch/): Updated to use the new API\n*   [Slack](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/): Made adding or removing the workflow link to a message easier\n\nBig datasets now render faster thanks to virtual scrolling and execution annotations are harder to delete.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.59.4[#](#n8n1594 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.59.3...n8n@1.59.4) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-09-20\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.60.1[#](#n8n1601 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.60.0...n8n@1.60.1) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-09-20\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.60.0[#](#n8n1600 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.59.3...n8n@1.60.0) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-09-18\n\nThis release contains new features, node enhancements and bug fixes.\n\nYou can now customize the maximum file size when uploading files within forms to webhooks.

We have also made querying executions faster.\n\n#### New credentials for the HTTP Request node[#](#new-credentials-for-the-http-request-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nWe added credential support for Datadog, Dynatrace, Elastic Security, Filescan, Iris, and Malcore to the HTTP Request node making it easier to use existing credentials.\n\nWe also made it easier to select workflows as tools when working with AI agents by implementing a new `workflow selector` parameter type.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n### Contributors[#](#contributors_10 \"Permanent link\")\n\n[Bram Kn](https://github.com/bramkn)\n\n## n8n@1.56.2[#](#n8n1562 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.56.1...n8n@1.56.2) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-08-26\n\nThis release contains a bug fix.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.56.1[#](#n8n1561 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.56.0...n8n@1.56.1) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-08-23\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.56.0[#](#n8n1560 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.55.3...n8n@1.56.0) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-08-21\n\nThis release contains node updates, security and bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n### Contributors[#](#contributors_11 \"Permanent link\")\n\n[CodeShakingSheep](https://github.com/CodeShakingSheep)  \n[Oz Weiss](https://github.com/thewizarodofoz)\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.55.3[#](#n8n1553 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.55.2...n8n@1.55.3) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-08-16\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.55.2[#](#n8n1552 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.55.1...n8n@1.55.2) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-08-16\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.55.1[#](#n8n1551 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.55.0...n8n@1.55.1) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-08-15\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.54.4[#](#n8n1544 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.54.3...n8n@1.54.4) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-08-15\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.54.3[#](#n8n1543 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.54.2...n8n@1.54.3) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-08-15\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.54.2[#](#n8n1542 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.54.1...n8n@1.54.2) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-08-14\n\nThis release contains bug fixes.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.55.0[#](#n8n1550 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.54.1...n8n@1.55.0) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-08-14\n\n[Breaking change](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/BREAKING-CHANGES.md)\n\nThe N8N\\_BLOCK\\_FILE\\_ACCESS\\_TO\\_N8N\\_FILES environment variable now also blocks access to n8n's static cache directory at ~/.cache/n8n/public.\n\nIf you are writing to or reading from a file at n8n's static cache directory via a node, e.g. Read/Write Files from Disk, please update your node to use a different path.\n\nThis release contains a new feature, a new node, a node update and bug fixes.\n\n#### Override the npm registry[#](#override-the-npm-registry \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis release adds the option to override the npm registry for installing community packages.

Manual workflow executions now use the same permissions checks as production executions, meaning you can't do a manual execution of a workflow if you don't have access to the credentials. Previously, owners and admins could do manual executions without credentials being shared with them. To resolve this, the credential creator needs to [share the credential](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/credential-sharing/) with you.\n\n#### New feature: Projects[#](#new-feature-projects \"Permanent link\")\n\nWith projects and roles, you can give your team access to collections of workflows and credentials, rather than having to share each workflow and credential individually. Simultaneously, you tighten security by limiting access to people on the relevant team.\n\nRefer to the [RBAC](https://docs.n8n.io/user-management/rbac/) documentation for information on creating projects and using roles.\n\nThe number of projects and role types vary depending on your plan. Refer to [Pricing](https://n8n.io/pricing/) for details.\n\n### Other highlights[#](#other-highlights \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   Improved [memory support for OpenAI assistants](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/#using-memory-with-openai-assistants).\n\n### Rolling back to a previous version[#](#rolling-back-to-a-previous-version \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you update to this version, then decide you need to role back:\n\nSelf-hosted n8n:\n\n1.  Delete any RBAC projects you created.\n2.  Revert the database migrations using `n8n db:revert`.\n\nCloud: contact [help@n8n.io](mailto:help@n8n.io).\n\n### Contributors[#](#contributors_19 \"Permanent link\")\n\n[Ayato Hayashi](https://github.com/hayashi-ay)  \n[Daniil Zobov](https://github.com/ddzobov)  \n[Guilherme Barile](https://github.com/GuilhermeBarile)  \n[Romain MARTINEAU](https://github.com/RJiraya)\n\n## n8n@1.42.1[#](#n8n1421 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.42.0...n8n@1.42.1) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-05-20\n\nThis is a bug fix release.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.41.1[#](#n8n1411 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.41.0...n8n@1.41.1) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-05-16\n\nThis is a bug fix release.\n\nFor full release details, refer to [Releases](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/releases) on GitHub.\n\n## n8n@1.42.0[#](#n8n1420 \"Permanent link\")\n\nView the [commits](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/compare/n8n@1.41.0...n8n@1.42.0) for this version.  \n**Release date:** 2024-05-15\n\nThis release contains new features, node enhancements, and bug fixes.\n\nNote that this release removes the AI error debugger.

In the HTTP Request node, select **Ask AI**.\n2.  Enter the **Service** and **Request** you want to use. For example, to use the NASA API to get their picture of the day, enter `NASA` in **Service** and `get picture of the day` in **Request**.\n3.

  "markdown": "# Node types | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/node-types.md \"Edit this page\")\n\n## Built-in integrations[#](#built-in-integrations \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis section contains the node library: reference documentation for every built-in node in n8n, and their credentials.\n\n## Node operations: Triggers and Actions[#](#node-operations-triggers-and-actions \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen you add a node to a workflow, n8n displays a list of available operations. An operation is something a node does, such as getting or sending data.\n\nThere are two types of operation:\n\n*   Triggers start a workflow in response to specific events or conditions in your services. When you select a Trigger, n8n adds a trigger node to your workflow, with the Trigger operation you chose pre-selected. When you search for a node in n8n, Trigger operations have a bolt icon ![Trigger icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/trigger.png).\n*   Actions are operations that represent specific tasks within a workflow, which you can use to manipulate data, perform operations on external systems, and trigger events in other systems as part of your workflows. When you select an Action, n8n adds a node to your workflow, with the Action operation you chose pre-selected.\n\n## Core nodes[#](#core-nodes \"Permanent link\")\n\nCore nodes can be actions or triggers. Whereas most nodes connect to a specific external service, core nodes provide functionality such as logic, scheduling, or generic API calls.\n\n## Cluster nodes[#](#cluster-nodes \"Permanent link\")\n\nCluster nodes are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a root node and one or more sub-nodes that extend the functionality of the node.\n\n![Screenshot of a workflow with a root node and two sub-nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-sub-nodes.png)\n\n## Credentials[#](#credentials \"Permanent link\")\n\nExternal services need a way to identify and authenticate users. This data can range from an API key over an email/password combination to a long multi-line private key. You can save these in n8n as credentials.\n\nNodes in n8n can then request that credential information. As another layer of security, only node types with specific access rights can access the credentials.\n\nTo make sure that the data is secure, it gets saved to the database encrypted. n8n uses a random personal encryption key, which it automatically generates on the first run of n8n and then saved under `~/.n8n/config`.\n\nTo learn more about creating, managing, and sharing credentials, refer to [Manage credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/).\n\nn8n supports custom nodes built by the community. Refer to [Community nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) for guidance on installing and using these nodes.\n\nFor help building your own custom nodes, and publish them to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), refer to [Creating nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/overview/) for more information."

It controls whether to disallow referencing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name (turned on), or allow it (turned off, default).\n*   **Merge Lists**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. Turn it on if the field to aggregate is a list and you want to output a single flat list rather than a list of lists.\n*   **Include Binaries**: The node displays this toggle for both Aggregate types. Turn it on if you want to include binary data from the input in the new output.\n*   **Keep Missing And Null Values**: The node displays this toggle when you select the **Individual Fields** Aggregate. Turn it on to add a null (empty) entry in the output list when there is a null or missing value in the input. If turned off, the output ignores null or empty values.\n\n## Templates and examples[#](#templates-and-examples \"Permanent link\")\n\nLearn more about [data structure and data flow](https://docs.n8n.io/data/) in n8n workflows."

Turn on **Allow Multiple HTTP Methods**.\n3.  Return to **Parameters**. By default, the node now accepts GET and POST calls. You can add other methods in the **HTTP Methods** field.\n\nThe Webhook node has an output for each method, so you can perform different actions depending on the method.\n\n## Use the HTTP Request node to trigger the Webhook node[#](#use-the-http-request-node-to-trigger-the-webhook-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node makes HTTP requests to the URL you specify.\n\n1.

Copy the URL from the Webhook node, and paste it in the **URL** field in the HTTP Request node.\n5.  If using the test URL for the webhook node: execute the workflow with the Webhook node.\n6.  Execute the HTTP Request node.\n\n## Use curl to trigger the Webhook node[#](#use-curl-to-trigger-the-webhook-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can use [curl](https://curl.se/) to make HTTP requests that trigger the Webhook node.\n\nNote\n\nIn the examples, replace `<https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>` with your webhook URL.  \nThe examples make GET requests. You can use whichever HTTP method you set in **HTTP Method**.\n\nMake an HTTP request without any parameters:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path>` |\n\nMake an HTTP request with a body parameter:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --data 'key=value'` |\n\nMake an HTTP request with header parameter:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --header 'key=value'` |\n\nMake an HTTP request to send a file:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `curl --request GET <https://your-n8n.url/webhook/path> --from 'key=@/path/to/file'` |\n\nReplace `/path/to/file` with the path of the file you want to send.\n\n## Send a response of type string[#](#send-a-response-of-type-string \"Permanent link\")\n\nBy default, the response format is JSON or an array. To send a response of type string:\n\n1.  Select **Response Mode** > **When Last Node Finishes**.\n2.  Select **Response Data** > **First Entry JSON**.\n3.  Select **Add Option** > **Property Name**.\n4.  Enter the name of the property that contains the response. This defaults to `data`.\n5.  Connect an [Edit Fields node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) to the Webhook node.\n6.  In the Edit Fields node, select **Add Value** > **String**.\n7.  Enter the name of the property in the **Name** field. The name should match the property name from step 4.\n8.  Enter the string value in the **Value** field.\n9.  Toggle **Keep Only Set** to on (green).\n\nWhen you call the Webhook, it sends the string response from the Edit Fields node.\n\n## Test URL versus Production URL[#](#test-url-versus-production-url \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n generates two **Webhook URLs** for each Webhook node: a **Test URL** and a **Production URL**.\n\nWhile building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL**. Once you're ready to use your Webhook URL in production, use the **Production URL**.\n\n| **URL type** | **How to trigger** | **Listening duration** | **Data shown in editor UI?** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Test URL | Select **Listen for test event** and trigger a test event from the source. | 120 seconds | ![✅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/2705.svg \":white_check_mark:\") |\n| Production URL | Activate the workflow | Until workflow deactivated | ![❌](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/274c.svg \":x:\") |\n\nRefer to [Workflow development](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/workflow-development/) for more information.\n\n## IPs in Whitelist are failing to connect[#](#ips-in-whitelist-are-failing-to-connect \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you're unable to connect from IPs in your IP Whitelist, check if you are running n8n behind a reverse proxy.\n\nIf so, set the `N8N_PROXY_HOPS` [environment variable](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) to the number of reverse-proxies n8n is running behind."

Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging.\n\nThere are two ways to test:\n\n*   Select **Test Step**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node, but not the rest of the workflow.\n*   Select **Test Workflow**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.\n\n## Production workflows[#](#production-workflows \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen your workflow is ready, switch to using the **Production URL**.

Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.\n\n## Set default selections with query parameters[#](#set-default-selections-with-query-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can set the initial values for fields by using [query parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Web_forms) with the initial URL provided by the n8n Form Trigger. Every [page in the form](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.form/) receives the same query parameters sent to the n8n Form Trigger URL.\n\nOnly for production\n\nQuery parameters are only available when using the form in production mode. n8n won't populate field values from query parameters in testing mode.\n\nWhen using query parameters, [percent-encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) any field names or values that use special characters. This ensures n8n uses the initial values for the given fields. You can use tools like [URL Encode/Decode](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/) to format your query parameters using percent-encoding.\n\nAs an example, imagine you have a form with the following properties:\n\n*   Production URL: `https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form`\n*   Fields:\n    *   `name`: `Jane Doe`\n    *   `email`: `jane.doe@example.com`\n\nWith query parameters and percent-encoding, you could use the following URL to set initial field values to the data above:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form?email=jane.doe%40example.com&name=Jane%20Doe` |\n\nHere, percent-encoding replaces the at-symbol (`@`) with the string `%40` and the space character () with the string `%20`. This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on.\n\n## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\nThese are the main node configuration fields:\n\n### Authentication[#](#authentication \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **Basic Auth**\n*   **None**\n\n#### Using basic auth[#](#using-basic-auth \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n*   The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting.\n*   The **Password** that goes with that username.\n\n### Form URLs[#](#form-urls \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Form Trigger node has two URLs: **Test URL** and **Production URL**. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel. Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.\n\n![Screenshot of the form URLs](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/form-trigger/form-urls.png)\n\n*   **Test URL**: n8n registers a test webhook when you select **Test Step** or **Test Workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.\n*   **Production URL**: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution. Select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.\n\n### Form Path[#](#form-path \"Permanent link\")\n\nSet a custom slug for the form.\n\n### Form Title[#](#form-title \"Permanent link\")\n\nEnter the title for your form. n8n displays the **Form Title** as the webpage title and main `h1` title on the form.\n\n### Form Description[#](#form-description \"Permanent link\")\n\nEnter the description for your form. n8n displays the **Form Description** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\\n` or `<br>` to add a line break.\n\n### Form Fields[#](#form-fields \"Permanent link\")\n\nCreate the question fields for your form. Select **Add Form Field** to add a new field.\n\nEvery field has the following settings:\n\n*   **Field Label**: Enter the label that appears above the input field.\n*   **Field Type**: Choose from **Date**, **Dropdown List**, **Email**, **File**, **Number**, **Password**, **Text**, or **Textarea**.\n    *   Select **Date** to include a date picker in the form. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/) for more information on formatting dates.\n    *   Select **Dropdown List** > **Add Field Option** to add multiple options. By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, turn on **Multiple Choice**.\n*   **Required Field**: Turn on to require users to complete this field on the form.\n\n### Respond When[#](#respond-when \"Permanent link\")\n\nChoose when n8n sends a response to the form submission. You can respond when:\n\n*   **Form Is Submitted**: Send a response to the user as soon as they submit the form.\n*   **Workflow Finishes**: Use this if you want the workflow to complete its execution before you send a response to the user. If the workflow errors, it sends a response to the user telling them there was a problem submitting the form.\n\n## Node options[#](#node-options \"Permanent link\")\n\nSelect **Add Option** to view more configuration options:\n\n*   **Append n8n Attribution**: Turn off to hide the **Form automated with n8n** attribute at the bottom of the form.\n*   **Form Response**: Choose how to respond when the user submits the form.\n    *   **Respond With** > **Form Submitted Text**: Show a message to the user.\n    *   **Respond With** > **Redirect URL**: Send the user to a new page.\n*   **Ignore Bots**: Turn on to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers.\n*   **Use Workflow Timezone**: Turn on to use the timezone in the [Workflow settings](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/) instead of UTC (default).

This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on.\n\n### Defining the form using JSON[#](#defining-the-form-using-json \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse **Define Form** > **Using JSON** to define the fields of your form with a [JSON array of objects](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-structure). Each object defines a single field by using a combination of these keys:\n\n*   `fieldLabel`: The label that appears above the input field.\n*   `fieldType`: Choose from `date`, `dropdown`, `email`, `file`, `number`, `password`, `text`, or `textarea`.\n    *   Use `date` to include a date picker in the form. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/) for more information on formatting dates.\n    *   When using `dropdown`, set the choices with `fieldOptions` (reference the example below). By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, set `multiselect` to `true`.\n    *   When using `file`, set `multipleFiles` to `true` to allow users to select more than one file. To define the file types to allow, set `acceptFileTypes` to a string containing a comma-separated list of file extensions (reference the example below).\n*   `placeholder`: Specify placeholder data for the field. You can use this for every `fieldType` except `dropdown`, `date`, and `file`.\n*   `requiredField`: Require users to complete this field on the form.\n\nAn example JSON that shows the general format required and the keys available:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29<br>30<br>31<br>32<br>33<br>34<br>35<br>36<br>37<br>38<br>39<br>40<br>41<br>42<br>43<br>44<br>45<br>46<br>47<br>48<br>49<br>50<br>51<br>52<br>53<br>54<br>55<br>56<br>57<br>58<br>59<br>60<br>61<br>62<br>63<br>64<br>65<br>66<br>67<br>68<br>69 | `// Use the \"requiredField\" key on any field to mark it as mandatory // Use the \"placeholder\" key to specify placeholder data for all fields //     except 'dropdown', 'date' and 'file'  [ \t{ \t\t\"fieldLabel\": \"Date Field\", \t\t\"fieldType\": \"date\", \t\t\"formatDate\": \"mm/dd/yyyy\", // how to format received date in n8n \t\t\"requiredField\": true \t}, \t{ \t\t\"fieldLabel\": \"Dropdown Options\", \t\t\"fieldType\": \"dropdown\", \t\t\"fieldOptions\": { \t\t\t\"values\": [ \t\t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\t\"option\": \"option 1\" \t\t\t\t}, \t\t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\t\"option\": \"option 2\" \t\t\t\t} \t\t\t] \t\t}, \t\t\"requiredField\": true \t}, \t{ \t\t\"fieldLabel\": \"Multiselect\", \t\t\"fieldType\": \"dropdown\", \t\t\"fieldOptions\": { \t\t\t\"values\": [ \t\t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\t\"option\": \"option 1\" \t\t\t\t}, \t\t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\t\"option\": \"option 2\" \t\t\t\t} \t\t\t] \t\t}, \t\t\"multiselect\": true // setting to true allows multi-select \t}, \t{ \t\t\"fieldLabel\": \"Email\", \t\t\"fieldType\": \"email\", \t\t\"placeholder\": \"me@mail.con\" \t}, \t{ \t\t\"fieldLabel\": \"File\", \t\t\"fieldType\": \"file\", \t\t\"multipleFiles\": true, // setting to true allows multiple files selection \t\t\"acceptFileTypes\": \".jpg, .png\" // allowed file types \t}, \t{ \t\t\"fieldLabel\": \"Number\", \t\t\"fieldType\": \"number\" \t}, \t{ \t\t\"fieldLabel\": \"Password\", \t\t\"fieldType\": \"password\" \t}, \t{ \t\t// \"fieldType\": \"text\" can be omitted since it's the default type \t\t\"fieldLabel\": \"Text\" \t}, \t{ \t\t\"fieldLabel\": \"Textarea\", \t\t\"fieldType\": \"textarea\" \t} ]` |\n\n### Form Ending[#](#form-ending \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse the **Form Ending** Page Type to end a form and either show a completion page or redirect the user to a URL. Only one Form Ending page is displayed per execution, even when n8n executes [multiple branches](#forms-with-branches) that contain Form Ending nodes.\n\nChoose between these options when using **On n8n Form Submission**:\n\n*   **Show Completion Screen**: Shows users a final screen to confirm that they submitted the form.\n    *   Fill in **Completion Title** to set the `h1` title on the form.\n    *   n8n displays the **Completion Message** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\\n` or `<br>` to add a line break.\n    *   Select **Add option** and fill in **Completion Page Title** to set the page's title in the browser tab.\n\nWhen using **Redirect to URL**, fill in the **URL** field with the page you want to redirect to when users complete the form.\n\n### Forms with branches[#](#forms-with-branches \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe n8n Form node executes and displays its associated form page whenever it receives data from a previous node. When building forms with n8n, to avoid confusion, it's important to understand how forms behave when branching occurs.\n\n#### Workflows with mutually exclusive branches[#](#workflows-with-mutually-exclusive-branches \"Permanent link\")\n\nForm workflows containing mutually exclusive branches work as expected. n8n will execute a single branch according to the submitted data and conditions you outline. As it executes, n8n will display each page in the branch, ending with an n8n Form node with the **Form Ending** page type.\n\nThis workflow demonstrates mutually exclusive branching. Each selection can only execute a single branch.\n\n#### Workflows that may execute multiple branches[#](#workflows-that-may-execute-multiple-branches \"Permanent link\")\n\nForm workflows that send data to multiple branches at the same time require more care. When multiple branches receive data during an execution (for example, from a [switch](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/) node), n8n executes each branch that receives data [sequentially](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/execution-order/). Upon reaching the end of one branch, the execution will move to the next branch with data.\n\nn8n only executes a single **Form Ending** n8n Form node for each execution. When multiple branches of a form workflow receive data, n8n ignores all Form Ending nodes except for the one associated with the final branch.\n\nThis workflow may execute more than one branch during an execution. Here, n8n executes all valid branches sequentially. This impacts which n8n Form nodes n8n executes (in particular, which **Form Ending** node displays):\n\n### Node options[#](#node-options \"Permanent link\")\n\nSelect **Add Option** to view more configuration options:\n\n*   **Form Title**: The title for your form. n8n displays the **Form Title** as the webpage title and main `h1` title on the form.\n*   **Form Description**: The description for your form. n8n displays the **Form Description** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\\n` or `<br>` to add a line break.\n*   **Button Label**: The label to use for your form's submit button. n8n displays the **Button Label** as the name of the submit button.\n\n## Running the node[#](#running-the-node \"Permanent link\")\n\n### Build and test workflows[#](#build-and-test-workflows \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhile building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL** in the [n8n Form Trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.formtrigger/). Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging.\n\nThere are two ways to test:\n\n*   Select **Test Step**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node and any previous nodes, but not the rest of the workflow.\n*   Select **Test Workflow**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.\n\n### Production workflows[#](#production-workflows \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen your workflow is ready, switch to using the n8n Form Trigger's **Production URL** by opening the trigger node and selecting the **Production URL** in the **From URLS** selector. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form.\n\nWhen working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.\n\n## Templates and examples[#](#templates-and-examples \"Permanent link\")"

You can use the Workflow Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.\n\n## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe node includes a single parameter to identify the **Events** that should trigger it. Choose from these events:\n\n*   **Active Workflow Updated**: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is updated.\n*   **Workflow Activated**: If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is activated.\n\nYou can select one or both of these events.\n\n## Templates and examples[#](#templates-and-examples \"Permanent link\")\n\n[Browse Workflow Trigger integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/workflow-trigger/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)"

Each of these objects wraps another object with the `json` key:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `[   {     \"json\": { \t  // your data goes here \t}   } ]` |\n\nTo troubleshoot this error, check the following:\n\n*   Read the [data structure](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-structure/) to understand the data you receive in the Code node and the requirements for outputting data from the node.\n*   Understand how data items work and how to connect data items from previous nodes with [item linking](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/).\n\n## A 'json' property isn't an object[#](#a-json-property-isnt-an-object \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis error occurs when the Code node returns data where the `json` key isn't pointing to an object.\n\nThis may happen if you set `json` to a different data structure, like an array:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | ``[   {     \"json\": [ \t  // Setting `json` to an array like this will produce an error \t]   } ]`` |\n\nTo resolve this, ensure that the `json` key references an object in your return data:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | ``[   {     \"json\": { \t  // Setting `json` to an object as expected \t}   } ]`` |\n\n## Code doesn't return an object[#](#code-doesnt-return-an-object \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis error may occur when your Code node doesn't return anything or if it returns an unexpected result.\n\nTo resolve this, ensure that your Code node returns the [expected data structure](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-structure/):\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `[   {     \"json\": { \t  // your data goes here \t}   } ]` |\n\nThis error may also occur if the code you provided returns `'undefined'` instead of the expected result. In that case, ensure that the data you are referencing in your Code node exists in each execution and that it has the structure your code expects.\n\n## 'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level[#](#import-and-export-may-only-appear-at-the-top-level \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis error occurs if you try to use `import` or `export` in the Code node. These aren't supported by n8n's JavaScript sandbox. Instead, use the `require` function to load modules.\n\nTo resolve this issue, try changing your `import` statements to use `require`:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `// Original code: // import express from \"express\"; // New code: const express = require(\"express\");` |\n\n## Cannot find module '<module>'[#](#cannot-find-module-module \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis error occurs if you try to use `require` in the Code node and n8n can't find the module.\n\nOnly for self-hosted\n\nn8n doesn't support importing modules in the [Cloud](https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/overview/) version.\n\nIf you're [self-hosting](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting) n8n, follow these steps:\n\n*   Install the module into your n8n environment.\n    *   If you are running n8n with [npm](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/), install the module in the same environment as n8n.\n    *   If you are running n8n with [Docker](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/), you need to extend the official n8n image with a [custom image](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/base-images/) that includes your module.\n*   Set the `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN` and `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL` [environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) to allow importing modules.\n\n## Using global variables[#](#using-global-variables \"Permanent link\")\n\nSometimes you may wish to set and retrieve simple global data related to a workflow across and within executions. For example, you may wish to include the date of the previous report when compiling a report with a list of project updates.\n\nTo set, update, and retrieve data directly to a workflow, use the [static data](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/builtin/get-workflow-static-data/) functions within your code. You can manage data either globally or tied to specific nodes.\n\nUse Remove Duplicates when possible\n\nIf you're interested in using variables to avoid processing the same data items more than once, consider using the [Remove Duplicates node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/) instead. The Remove Duplicates node can save information across executions to avoid processing the same items multiple times."

When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.\n*   **Run Once for Each Item**: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.\n\n## JavaScript[#](#javascript \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Code node supports Node.js.\n\n### Supported JavaScript features[#](#supported-javascript-features \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Code node supports:\n\n*   Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.\n*   Writing to your browser console using `console.log`. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.\n\n### External libraries[#](#external-libraries \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the [Enable modules in Code node](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) guide.\n\nIf you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you:\n\n*   [crypto Node.js module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/crypto.html)\n*   [moment npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)\n\n### Built-in methods and variables[#](#built-in-methods-and-variables \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/overview/) for more information.\n\nThe syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `$variableName` or `$methodName()`. Type `$` in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables.\n\n## Python[#](#python \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the [Packages included with Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide). n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.\n\nSlower than JavaScript\n\nThe Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.\n\n### Built-in methods and variables[#](#built-in-methods-and-variables_1 \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/overview/) for more information.\n\nThe syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `_variableName` or `_methodName()`. Type `_` in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables.\n\n## File system and HTTP requests[#](#file-system-and-http-requests \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead:\n\n*   [Read/Write File From Disk](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)\n*   [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)\n\n## Coding in n8n[#](#coding-in-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nThere are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks.\n\n### Key concepts[#](#key-concepts \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts:\n\n*   [Data structure](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-structure/): understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.\n*   [Item linking](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/): learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match.\n\n### Built-in methods and variables[#](#built-in-methods-and-variables_2 \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:\n\n*   Accessing specific item data\n*   Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment\n*   Convenience variables to help with data and time\n\nRefer to [Built-in methods and variables](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/overview) for more information.\n\n## Use AI in the Code node[#](#use-ai-in-the-code-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nFeature availability\n\nAI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n.\n\nAI generated code overwrites your code\n\nIf you've already written some code on the **Code** tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed.\n\nTo use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node:\n\n1.  In the Code node, set **Language** to **JavaScript**.\n2.  Select the **Ask AI** tab.\n3.  Write your query.\n4.  Select **Generate Code**. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the **Code** tab.\n\n## Common issues[#](#common-issues \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common Issues](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/common-issues/)."

[Get in touch](mailto:license@n8n.io) for more information.\n\nn8n's [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md) are based on the [fair-code](http://faircode.io/) model.\n\n## License FAQs[#](#license-faqs \"Permanent link\")\n\n### What license do you use?[#](#what-license-do-you-use \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n uses the [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) and [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md). These licenses are based on the [fair-code](http://faircode.io/) model.\n\n### What source code is covered by the Sustainable Use License?[#](#what-source-code-is-covered-by-the-sustainable-use-license \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe [Sustainable Use License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE.md) applies to all our source code hosted in our [main GitHub repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) except:\n\n*   Content of branches other than master.\n*   Source code files that contain `.ee.` in their file name. These are licensed under the [n8n Enterprise License](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/LICENSE_EE.md).\n\n### What is the Sustainable Use License?[#](#what-is-the-sustainable-use-license \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Sustainable Use License is a fair-code software license created by n8n in 2022. You can read more about why we did this [here](#why-did-you-create-a-license). The license allows you the free right to use, modify, create derivative works, and redistribute, with three limitations:\n\n*   You may use or modify the software only for your own internal business purposes or for non-commercial or personal use.\n*   You may distribute the software or provide it to others only if you do so free of charge for non-commercial purposes.\n*   You may not alter, remove, or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices of the licensor in the software. Any use of the licensor's trademarks is subject to applicable law.\n\nWe encourage anyone who wants to use the Sustainable Use License. If you are building something out in the open, it makes sense to think about licensing earlier in order to avoid problems later. Contact us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io) if you would like to ask any questions about it.\n\n### What is and isn't allowed under the license in the context of n8n's product?[#](#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product \"Permanent link\")\n\nOur license restricts use to \"internal business purposes\". In practice this means all use is allowed unless you are selling a product, service, or module in which the value derives entirely or substantially from n8n functionality. Here are some examples that wouldn't be allowed:\n\n*   White-labeling n8n and offering it to your customers for money.\n*   Hosting n8n and charging people money to access it.\n\nAll of the following examples are allowed under our license:\n\n*   Using n8n to sync the data you control as a company, for example from a CRM to an internal database.\n*   Creating an n8n node for your product or any other integration between your product and n8n.\n*   Providing consulting services related to n8n, for example building workflows, custom features closely connect to n8n, or code that gets executed by n8n.\n*   Supporting n8n, for example by setting it up or maintaining it on an internal company server.\n\n#### Can I use n8n to act as the back-end to power a feature in my app?[#](#can-i-use-n8n-to-act-as-the-back-end-to-power-a-feature-in-my-app \"Permanent link\")\n\nUsually yes, as long as the back-end process doesn't use users' own credentials to access their data.\n\nHere are two examples to clarify:\n\n##### Example 1: Sync ACME app with HubSpot[#](#example-1-sync-acme-app-with-hubspot \"Permanent link\")\n\nBob sets up n8n to collect a user's HubSpot credentials to sync data in the ACME app with data in HubSpot.\n\n**NOT ALLOWED** under the Sustainable Use License. This use case collects the user's own HubSpot credentials to pull information to feed into the ACME app.\n\n##### Example 2: Embed AI chatbot in ACME app[#](#example-2-embed-ai-chatbot-in-acme-app \"Permanent link\")\n\nBob sets up n8n to embed an AI chatbot within the ACME app. The AI chatbot's credentials in n8n use Bob's company credentials. ACME app end-users only enter their questions or queries to the chatbot.\n\n**ALLOWED** under the Sustainable Use License. No user credentials are being collected.\n\n### What if I want to use n8n for something that's not permitted by the license?[#](#what-if-i-want-to-use-n8n-for-something-thats-not-permitted-by-the-license \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou must sign a separate commercial agreement with us. We actively encourage software creators to embed n8n within their products; we just ask them to sign an agreement laying out the terms of use, and the fees owed to n8n for using the product in this way. We call this mode of use n8n Embed. You can learn more, and contact us about it [here](https://n8n.io/embed).\n\nIf you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at [the examples](#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product), and if you're still unclear, email us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).\n\n### Why don't you use an open source license?[#](#why-dont-you-use-an-open-source-license \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n's mission is to give everyone who uses a computer technical superpowers. We've decided the best way for us to achieve this mission is to make n8n as widely and freely available as possible for users, while ensuring we can build a sustainable, viable business. By making our product free to use, easy to distribute, and source-available we help everyone access the product. By operating as a business, we can continue to release features, fix bugs, and provide reliable software at scale long-term.\n\n### Why did you create a license?[#](#why-did-you-create-a-license \"Permanent link\")\n\nCreating a license was our least favorite option. We only went down this path after reviewing the possible existing licenses and deciding nothing fit our specific needs. There are two ways in which we try to mitigate the pain and friction of using a proprietary license:\n\n1.  By using plain English, and keeping it as short as possible.\n2.  By promoting [fair-code](https://faircode.io/) with the goal of making it a well-known umbrella term to describe software models like ours.\n\nOur goals when we created the Sustainable Use License were:\n\n1.  To be as permissive as possible.\n2.  Safeguarding our ability to build a business.\n3.  Being as clear as possible what use was permitted or not.\n\n### My company has a policy against using code that restricts commercial use – can I still use n8n?[#](#my-company-has-a-policy-against-using-code-that-restricts-commercial-use-can-i-still-use-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nProvided you are using n8n for internal business purposes, and not making n8n available to your customers for them to connect their accounts and build workflows, you should be able to use n8n. If you are unsure whether the use case you have in mind constitutes an internal business purpose or not, take a look at [the examples](#what-is-and-isnt-allowed-under-the-license-in-the-context-of-n8ns-product), and if you're still unclear, email us at [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).\n\n### What happens to the code I contribute to n8n in light of the Sustainable Use License?[#](#what-happens-to-the-code-i-contribute-to-n8n-in-light-of-the-sustainable-use-license \"Permanent link\")\n\nAny code you contribute on GitHub is subject to GitHub's [terms of use](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#d-user-generated-content). In simple terms, this means you own, and are responsible for, anything you contribute, but that you grant other GitHub users certain rights to use this code. When you contribute code to a repository containing notice of a license, you license the code under the same terms.\n\nn8n asks every contributor to sign our [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md). In addition to the above, this gives n8n the ability to change its license without seeking additional permission. It also means you aren't liable for your contributions (e.g. in case they cause damage to someone else's business).\n\nIt's easy to get started contributing code to n8n [here](https://github.com/n8n-io), and we've listed broader ways of participating in our community [here](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/contributing.html).\n\n### Why did you switch to the Sustainable Use License from your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?[#](#why-did-you-switch-to-the-sustainable-use-license-from-your-previous-license-arrangement-apache-20-with-commons-clause \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n was licensed under Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause until 17 March 2022. Commons Clause was initiated by various software companies wanting to protect their rights against cloud providers. The concept involved adding a commercial restriction on top of an existing open source license.\n\nHowever, the use of the Commons Clause as an additional condition to an open source license, as well as the use of wording that's open to interpretation, created some confusion and uncertainty regarding the terms of use. The Commons Clause also restricted people's ability to offer consulting and support services: we realized these services are critical in enabling people to get value from n8n, so we wanted to remove this restriction.\n\nWe created the Sustainable Use License to be more permissive and more clear about what use is allowed, while continuing to ensure n8n gets the funding needed to build and improve our product.\n\n### What are the main differences between the Sustainable Use License and your previous license arrangement (Apache 2.0 with Commons Clause)?[#](#what-are-the-main-differences-between-the-sustainable-use-license-and-your-previous-license-arrangement-apache-20-with-commons-clause \"Permanent link\")\n\nThere are two main differences between the Sustainable Use License and our previous license arrangement. The first is that we have tightened the definition of how you can use the software. Previously the Commons Clause restricted users ability to \"sell\" the software; we have redefined this to restrict use to internal business purposes. The second difference is that our previous license restricted people's ability to charge fees for consulting or support services related to the software: we have lifted that restriction altogether.\n\nThat means you are now free to offer commercial consulting or support services (e.g. building n8n workflows) without the need for a separate license agreement with us. If you are interested in joining our community of n8n experts providing these services, you can learn more here.\n\n### Is n8n open source?[#](#is-n8n-open-source \"Permanent link\")\n\nAlthough n8n's source code is available under the Sustainable Use License, according to the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) (OSI), open source licenses can't include limitations on use, so we do not call ourselves open source. In practice, n8n offers most users many of the same benefits as OSI-approved open source.\n\nWe coined the term ['fair-code'](https://faircode.io/) as a way of describing our licensing model, and the model of other companies who are source-available, but restrict commercial use of their source code.\n\n### What is fair-code, and how does the Sustainable Use License relate to it?[#](#what-is-fair-code-and-how-does-the-sustainable-use-license-relate-to-it \"Permanent link\")\n\nFair-code isn't a software license. It describes a software model where software:\n\n*   Is generally free to use and can be distributed by anybody.\n*   Has its source code openly available.\n*   Can be extended by anybody in public and private communities.\n*   Is commercially restricted by its authors.\n\nThe Sustainable Use License is a fair-code license. You can read more about it and see other examples of fair-code licenses [here](https://faircode.io/).\n\nWe're always excited to talk about software licenses, fair-code, and other principles around sharing code with interested parties. To get in touch to chat, email [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io).\n\n### Can I use n8n's Sustainable Use License for my own project?[#](#can-i-use-n8ns-sustainable-use-license-for-my-own-project \"Permanent link\")\n\nYes! We're excited to see more software use the Sustainable Use License. We'd love to hear about your project if you're using our license: [license@n8n.io](mailto:license@n8n.io)."

Decide which fields to compare. In **Input A Field**, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream A. In **Input B Field**, enter the name of the field you want to use from input stream B.\n2.  **Optional**: You can compare by multiple fields. Select **Add Fields to Match** to set up more comparisons.\n3.  Choose how to handle differences between the datasets. In **When There Are Differences**, select one of the following:\n    *   **Use Input A Version** to treat input stream A as the source of truth.\n    *   **Use Input B Version** to treat input stream B as the source of truth.\n    *   **Use a Mix of Versions** to use different inputs for different fields.\n        *   Use **Prefer** to select either **Input A Version** or **Input B Version** as the main source of truth.\n        *   Enter input fields that are exceptions to **For Everything Except** to pull from the other input source. To add multiple input fields, enter a comma-separated list.\n    *   **Include Both Versions** to include both input streams in the output, which may make the structure more complex.\n4.  Decide whether to use **Fuzzy Compare**. When turned on, the comparison will tolerate small type differences when comparing fields. For example, the number 3 and the string `3` are treated as the same with **Fuzzy Compare** turned on, but wouldn't be treated the same with it turned off.\n\n## Understand item comparison[#](#understand-item-comparison \"Permanent link\")\n\nItem comparison is a two stage process:\n\n1.  n8n checks if the values of the fields you selected to compare match across both inputs.\n2.  If the fields to compare match, n8n then compares all fields within the items, to determine if the items are the same or different.\n\n## Node options[#](#node-options \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse the node **Options** to refine your comparison or tweak comparison behavior.\n\n### Fields to Skip Comparing[#](#fields-to-skip-comparing \"Permanent link\")\n\nEnter field names that you want to ignore in the comparison.\n\nFor example, if you compare the two datasets below using `person.language` as the **Fields to Match**, n8n returns them as different. If you add `person.name` to **Fields to Skip Comparing**, n8n returns them as matching.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29<br>30<br>31<br>32<br>33<br>34<br>35<br>36<br>37<br>38<br>39<br>40<br>41<br>42<br>43<br>44<br>45<br>46<br>47<br>48 | `// Input 1 \t[ \t\t{ \t\t\t\"person\": \t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\"name\":\t\"Stefan\", \t\t\t\t\"language\":\t\"de\" \t\t\t} \t\t}, \t\t{ \t\t\t\"person\": \t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\"name\":\t\"Jim\", \t\t\t\t\"language\":\t\"en\" \t\t\t} \t\t}, \t\t{ \t\t\t\"person\": \t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\"name\":\t\"Hans\", \t\t\t\t\"language\":\t\"de\" \t\t\t} \t\t} \t] \t// Input 2 \t\t[ \t\t{ \t\t\t\"person\": \t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\"name\":\t\"Sara\", \t\t\t\t\"language\":\t\"de\" \t\t\t} \t\t}, \t\t{ \t\t\t\"person\": \t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\"name\":\t\"Jane\", \t\t\t\t\"language\":\t\"en\" \t\t\t} \t\t}, \t\t{ \t\t\t\"person\": \t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\"name\":\t\"Harriet\", \t\t\t\t\"language\":\t\"de\" \t\t\t} \t\t} \t]` |\n\n### Disable Dot Notation[#](#disable-dot-notation \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhether to disallow referencing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name (turned on) or allow it (turned off, default).\n\n### Multiple Matches[#](#multiple-matches \"Permanent link\")\n\nChoose how to handle duplicate data.

  "markdown": "# Remove Duplicates node documentation | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/index.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nUse the Remove Duplicates node to identify and delete items that are:\n\n*   identical across all fields or a subset of fields in a single execution\n*   identical to or surpassed by items seen in previous executions\n\nThis is helpful in situations where you can end up with duplicate data, such as a user creating multiple accounts, or a customer submitting the same order multiple times. When working with large datasets it becomes more difficult to spot and remove these items.\n\nBy comparing against data from previous executions, the Remove Duplicates node can delete items seen in earlier executions. It can also ensure that new items have a later date or a higher value than previous values.\n\nMajor changes in 1.64.0\n\nThe n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 1.64.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/7a66308290e6e5b104fcb82a3beafa0d6987df36/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates.md).\n\n## Operation modes[#](#operation-modes \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe remove duplication node works differently depending on the value of the **operation** parameter:\n\n*   **[Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input](#remove-items-repeated-within-current-input)**: Identify and remove duplicate items in the current input across all fields or a subset of fields.\n*   **[Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions](#remove-items-processed-in-previous-executions)**: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates.\n*   **[Clear Deduplication History](#clear-deduplication-history)**: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.\n\n### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input[#](#remove-items-repeated-within-current-input \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen you set the \"Operations\" field to **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input**, the Remove Duplicate node identifies and removes duplicate items in the current input. It can do this across all fields, or within a subset of fields.\n\n#### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input parameters[#](#remove-items-repeated-within-current-input-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen using the **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input** operation, the following parameter is available:\n\n*   **Compare**: Select which fields of the input data n8n should compare to check if they're the same. The following options are available:\n    *   **All Fields**: Compares all fields of the input data.\n    *   **All Fields Except**: Enter which input data fields n8n should exclude from the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.\n    *   **Selected Fields**: Enter which input data fields n8n should include in the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.\n\n#### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input options[#](#remove-items-repeated-within-current-input-options \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you choose **All Fields Except** or **Selected Fields** as your compare type, you can add these options:\n\n*   **Disable Dot Notation**: Set whether to use dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child` (turned off) or not (turn on).\n*   **Remove Other Fields**: Set whether to remove any fields that aren't used in the comparison (turned on) or not (turned off).\n\n### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions[#](#remove-items-processed-in-previous-executions \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen you set the \"Operation\" field to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**, the Remove Duplicate node compares items in the current input to items from previous executions.\n\n#### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions parameters[#](#remove-items-processed-in-previous-executions-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen using the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation, the following parameters are available:\n\n*   **Keep Items Where**: Select how n8n decides which items to keep. The following options are available:\n    \n    *   **Value Is New**: n8n removes items if their value matches items from earlier executions.\n    *   **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**: n8n removes items if the current value isn't higher than previous values.\n    *   **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date**: n8n removes date items if the current date isn't later than previous dates.\n*   **Value to Dedupe On**: The input field or fields to compare. The option you select for the **Keep Items Where** parameter determines the exact format you need:\n    \n    *   When using **Value Is New**, this must be an input field or combination of fields with a unique ID.\n    *   When using **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**, this must be an input field or combination of fields that has an incremental value.\n    *   When using **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date**, this must be an input field that has a date value in ISO format.\n\n#### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions options[#](#remove-items-processed-in-previous-executions-options \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen using the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation, the following option is available:\n\n*   **Scope**: Sets how n8n stores and uses the deduplication data for comparisons. The following options are available:\n    *   **Node**: (default) Stores the data for this node independently from other Remove Duplicates instances in the workflow. When you use this scope, you can [clear the duplication history](#clear-deduplication-history) for this node instance without affecting other nodes.\n    *   **Workflow**: Stores the duplication data at the workflow level. This shares duplication data with any other Remove Duplicate nodes set to use \"workflow\" scope. n8n will still manage the duplication data for other Remove Duplicate nodes set to \"node\" scope independently.\n\nWhen you select **Value Is New** as your **Keep Items Where** choice, this option is also available:\n\n*   **History Size**: The number of items for n8n to store to track duplicates across executions. The value of the **Scope** option determines whether this history size is specific to this individual Remove Duplicate node instance or shared with other instances in the workflow. By default, n8n stores 10,000 items.\n\n### Clear Deduplication History[#](#clear-deduplication-history \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen you set the \"Operation\" field to **Clear Deduplication History**, the Remove Duplicates node manages and clears the stored items from previous executions. This operation doesn't affect any items in the current input. Instead, it manages the database of items that the \"Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions\" operation uses.\n\n#### Clear Deduplication History parameters[#](#clear-deduplication-history-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen using the **Clear Deduplication History** operation, the following parameter is available:\n\n*   **Mode**: How you want to manage the key / value items stored in the database. The following option is available:\n    *   **Clean Database**: Deletes all duplication data stored in the database. This resets the duplication database to its original state.\n\n#### Clear Deduplication History options[#](#clear-deduplication-history-options \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen using the **Clear Deduplication History** operation, the following option is available:\n\n*   **Scope**: Sets the scope n8n uses when managing the duplication database.\n    *   **Node**: (default) Manages the duplication database specific to this Remove Duplicates node instance.\n    *   **Workflow**: Manages the duplication database shared by all Remove Duplicate node instances that use workflow scope.\n\n## Templates and examples[#](#templates-and-examples \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor templates using the Remove Duplicates node and examples of how to use it, refer to [Templates and examples](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/templates-and-examples/).\n\nLearn more about [data structure and data flow](https://docs.n8n.io/data/) in n8n workflows."

For example, passing a user ID stored in a site cookie.\n\nTo do this, use the `metadata` field in the JSON object you pass to the `createChat` function in your embedded chat window:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `createChat({ \twebhookUrl: 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL', \tmetadata: { \t\t'YOUR_KEY': 'YOUR_DATA' \t}; });` |\n\nThe `metadata` field can contain arbitrary data that will appear in the Chat Trigger output alongside other output data. From there, you can query and process the data from downstream nodes as usual using n8n's [data processing features](https://docs.n8n.io/data/).\n\n## Chat Trigger node doesn't fetch previous messages[#](#chat-trigger-node-doesnt-fetch-previous-messages \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen you configure a Chat Trigger node, you might experience problems fetching previous messages if you aren't careful about how you configure session loading. This often manifests as a `workflow could not be started!` error.\n\nIn Chat Triggers, the **Load Previous Session** option retrieves previous chat messages for a session using the `sessionID`. When you set the **Load Previous Session** option to **From memory**, it's almost always best to [connect the same memory node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/#load-previous-session) to both the Chat Trigger and the Agent in your workflow:\n\n1.  In your **Chat Trigger** node, set the **Load Previous Session** option to **From Memory**. This is only visible if you've made the chat publicly available.\n2.  Attach a **Window Buffer Memory** node to the **Memory** connector.\n3.  Attach the same **Window Buffer Memory** node to **Memory** connector of your **Agent**.\n4.  In the **Window Buffer Memory** node, set **Session ID** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node**.\n\nOne instance where you may want to attach separate memory nodes to your Chat Trigger and the Agent is if you want to set the **Session ID** in your memory node to **Define below**.\n\nIf you're retrieving the session ID from an expression, the same expression must work for each of the nodes attached to it. If the expression isn't compatible with each of the nodes that need memory, you might need to use separate memory nodes so you can customize the expression for the session ID on a per-node basis."

This node works with the [Webhook](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node.\n\nRuns once for the first data item\n\nThe Respond to Webhook node runs once, using the first incoming data item. Refer to [Return more than one data item](#return-more-than-one-data-item) for more information.\n\n## How to use Respond to Webhook[#](#how-to-use-respond-to-webhook \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo use the Respond to Webhook node:\n\n1.  Add a [Webhook](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) node as the trigger node for the workflow.\n2.  In the Webhook node, set **Respond** to **Using 'Respond to Webhook' node**.\n3.  Add the Respond to Webhook node anywhere in your workflow. If you want it to return data from other nodes, place it after those nodes.\n\n## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\nConfigure the node behavior using these parameters.\n\n### Respond With[#](#respond-with \"Permanent link\")\n\nChoose what data to send in the webhook response.\n\n*   **All Incoming Items**: Respond with all the JSON items from the input.\n*   **Binary**: Respond with a binary file defined in **Response Data Source**.\n*   **First Incoming Item**: Respond with the first incoming item's JSON.\n*   **JSON**: Respond with a JSON object defined in **Response Body**.\n*   **No Data**: No response payload.\n*   **Redirect**: Redirect to a URL set in **Redirect URL**.\n*   **Text**: Respond with text set in **Response Body**.\n\n## Node options[#](#node-options \"Permanent link\")\n\nSelect **Add Option** to view and set the options.\n\n*   **Response Code**: Set the [response code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) to use.\n*   **Response Headers**: Define the response headers to send.\n*   **Put Response in Field**: Available when you respond with **All Incoming Items** or **First Incoming Item**. Set the field name for the field containing the response data.\n\n## Templates and examples[#](#templates-and-examples \"Permanent link\")\n\n## Workflow behavior[#](#workflow-behavior \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen using the Respond to Webhook node, workflows behave as follows:\n\n*   The workflow finishes without executing the Respond to Webhook node: it returns a standard message with a 200 status.\n*   The workflow errors before the first Respond to Webhook node executes: the workflow returns an error message with a 500 status.\n*   A second Respond to Webhook node executes after the first one: the workflow ignores it.\n*   A Respond to Webhook node executes but there was no webhook: the workflow ignores the Respond to Webhook node.\n\n## Return more than one data item (deprecated)[#](#return-more-than-one-data-item-deprecated \"Permanent link\")\n\nDeprecated in 1.22.0\n\nn8n 1.22.0 added support for returning all data items using the **All Incoming Items** option. n8n recommends upgrading to the latest version of n8n, instead of using the workarounds described in this section.\n\nThe Respond to Webhook node runs once, using the first incoming data item. This includes when using [expressions](https://docs.n8n.io/code/expressions/). You can't force looping using the Loop node: the workflow will run, but the webhook response will still only contain the results of the first execution.\n\nIf you need to return more than one data item, choose one of these options:\n\n*   Instead of using the Respond to Webhook node, use the **When Last Node Finishes** option in **Respond** in the Webhook node. Use this when you want to return the final data that the workflow outputs.\n*   Use the [Aggregate](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/) node to turn multiple items into a single item before passing the data to the Respond to Webhook node. Set **Aggregate** to **All Item Data (Into a Single List)**."

You can find the trigger node docs [here](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtabletrigger/).\n\nRefer to [Airtable's documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction) for more information about the service.\n\n## What to do if your operation isn't supported[#](#what-to-do-if-your-operation-isnt-supported \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.\n\nYou can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:\n\n1.  In the HTTP Request node, select **Authentication** > **Predefined Credential Type**.\n2.  Select the service you want to connect to.\n3.  Select your credential.\n\nRefer to [Custom API operations](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/custom-operations/) for more information.\n\n## Node reference[#](#node-reference \"Permanent link\")\n\n### Get the Record ID[#](#get-the-record-id \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo fetch data for a particular record, you need the Record ID. There are two ways to get the Record ID.\n\n### Create a Record ID column in Airtable[#](#create-a-record-id-column-in-airtable \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo create a `Record ID` column in your table, refer to this [article](https://support.airtable.com/docs/finding-airtable-ids). You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.\n\n### Use the List operation[#](#use-the-list-operation \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo get the Record ID of your record, you can use the **List** operation of the Airtable node. This operation will return the Record ID along with the fields. You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.\n\n### Filter records when using the List operation[#](#filter-records-when-using-the-list-operation \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo filter records from your Airtable base, use the **Filter By Formula** option. For example, if you want to return all the users that belong to the organization `n8n`, follow the steps mentioned below:\n\n1.  Select 'List' from the **Operation** dropdown list.\n2.  Enter the base ID and the table name in the **Base ID** and **Table** field, respectively.\n3.  Click on **Add Option** and select 'Filter By Formula' from the dropdown list.\n4.  Enter the following formula in the **Filter By Formula** field: `{Organization}='n8n'`.\n\nSimilarly, if you want to return all the users that don't belong to the organization `n8n`, use the following formula: `NOT({Organization}='n8n')`.\n\nRefer to the Airtable [documentation](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/203255215-Formula-Field-Reference) to learn more about the formulas.\n\n## Common issues[#](#common-issues \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor common errors or issues and suggested resolution steps, refer to [Common Issues](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/common-issues/)."

The workflow timezone, if set. Refer to [Workflow settings](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/) for more information.\n2.  The n8n instance timezone, if the workflow timezone isn't set. The default is `America/New York` for self-hosted instances. n8n Cloud tries to detect the instance owner's timezone when they sign up, falling back to GMT as the default. Self-hosted users can change the instance setting using [Environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization). Cloud admins can change the instance timezone in the [Admin dashboard](https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/).\n\nDate and time in other nodes\n\nYou can work with data and time in the Code node, and in expressions in any node. n8n supports Luxon to help work with date and time in JavaScript.

The full text looks something like this:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `There was a problem loading the parameter options from server: \"Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials?\"` |\n\nThe error most often displays when the credential you're using doesn't have the scopes it requires on the resources you're attempting to manage.\n\nRefer to the [Airtable credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/airtable/) and [Airtables scopes documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/scopes) for more information.\n\n## Service is receiving too many requests from you[#](#service-is-receiving-too-many-requests-from-you \"Permanent link\")\n\nAirtable has a hard API limit on the number of requests generated using personal access tokens.\n\nIf you send more than five requests per second per base, you will receive a 429 error, indicating that you have sent too many requests. You will have to wait 30 seconds before resuming requests. This same limit applies for sending more than 50 requests across all bases per access token.\n\nYou can find out more in the [Airtable's rate limits documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/rate-limits).

Turn it on when you're ready to activate the workflow and allow users to access the chat.\n\n### Mode[#](#mode \"Permanent link\")\n\nChoose how users access the chat. Select from:\n\n*   **Hosted Chat**: Use n8n's hosted chat interface. Recommended for most users because you can configure the interface using the [node options](#node-options) and don't have to do any other setup.\n*   **Embedded Chat**: This option requires you to create your own chat interface. You can use n8n's [chat widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8n/chat) or build your own. Your chat interface must call the webhook URL shown in **Chat URL** in the node.\n\n### Authentication[#](#authentication \"Permanent link\")\n\nChoose whether and how to restrict access to the chat. Select from:\n\n*   **None**: The chat doesn't use authentication. Anyone can use the chat.\n*   **Basic Auth**: The chat uses basic authentication.\n    *   Select or create a **Credential for Basic Auth** with a username and password. All users must use the same username and password.\n*   **n8n User Auth**: Only users logged in to an n8n account can use the chat.\n\n### Initial Message(s)[#](#initial-messages \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis parameter's only available if you're using **Hosted Chat**.

Instead, you want to take the output of an Agent or Chain node and modify it or do something else with it before sending it back to the user.\n\nIn a basic workflow, the Agent and Chain nodes output a parameter named either `output` or `text`, and the Chat trigger sends the value of this parameter to the user as the chat response.\n\nIf you need to manually create the response sent to the user, you must create a parameter named either `text` or `output`. If you use a different parameter name, the Chat trigger sends the entire object as its response, not just the value.\n\n## Common issues[#](#common-issues \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common Issues](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/common-issues/)."

  "markdown": "# Schedule Trigger node documentation | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/index.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nUse the Schedule Trigger node to run workflows at fixed intervals and times. This works in a similar way to the Cron software utility in Unix-like systems.\n\nYou must activate the workflow\n\nIf a workflow uses the Schedule node as a trigger, make sure that you save and activate the workflow.\n\nTimezone settings\n\nThe node relies on the timezone setting. n8n uses either:\n\n1.  The workflow timezone, if set. Refer to [Workflow settings](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/) for more information.\n2.  The n8n instance timezone, if the workflow timezone isn't set. The default is `America/New York` for self-hosted instances. n8n Cloud tries to detect the instance owner's timezone when they sign up, falling back to GMT as the default. Self-hosted users can change the instance setting using [Environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization). Cloud admins can change the instance timezone in the [Admin dashboard](https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/).\n\n## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\nAdd **Trigger Rules** to determine when the trigger should run.\n\nUse the **Trigger Interval** to select the time interval unit of measure to schedule the trigger for. All other parameters depend on the interval you select. Choose from:\n\n*   [Seconds trigger interval](#seconds-trigger-interval)\n*   [Minutes trigger interval](#minutes-trigger-interval)\n*   [Hours trigger interval](#hours-trigger-interval)\n*   [Days trigger interval](#days-trigger-interval)\n*   [Weeks trigger interval](#weeks-trigger-interval)\n*   [Months trigger interval](#months-trigger-interval)\n*   [Custom (Cron) interval](#custom-cron-interval)\n\nYou can add multiple **Trigger Rules** to run the node on different schedules.\n\nRefer to the sections below for more detail on configuring each **Trigger Interval**. Refer to [Templates and examples](#templates-and-examples) for further examples.\n\n### Seconds trigger interval[#](#seconds-trigger-interval \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **Seconds Between Triggers**: Enter the number of seconds between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter `30` here, the trigger will run every 30 seconds.\n\n### Minutes trigger interval[#](#minutes-trigger-interval \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **Minutes Between Triggers**: Enter the number of minutes between each workflow trigger. For example, if you enter `5` here, the trigger will run every 5 minutes.\n\n### Hours trigger interval[#](#hours-trigger-interval \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **Hours Between Triggers**: Enter the number of hours between each workflow trigger.\n*   **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.\n\nFor example, if you enter `6` **Hours Between Triggers** and `30` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run every six hours at 30 minutes past the hour.\n\n### Days trigger interval[#](#days-trigger-interval \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **Days Between Triggers**: Enter the number of days between each workflow trigger.\n*   **Trigger at Hour**: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.\n*   **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.\n\nFor example, if you enter `2` **Days Between Triggers**, **9am** for **Trigger at Hour**, and `15` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run every two days at 9:15am.\n\n### Weeks trigger interval[#](#weeks-trigger-interval \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **Weeks Between Triggers**: Enter the number of weeks between each workflow trigger.\n*   **Trigger on Weekdays**: Select the day(s) of the week you want to trigger the node.\n*   **Trigger at Hour**: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.\n*   **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.\n\nFor example, if you enter `2` **Weeks Between Triggers**, **Monday** for **Trigger on Weekdays**, **3pm** for **Trigger at Hour**, and `30` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run every two weeks on Monday at 3:30 PM.\n\n### Months trigger interval[#](#months-trigger-interval \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **Months Between Triggers**: Enter the number of months between each workflow trigger.\n*   **Trigger at Day of Month**: Enter the day of the month the day should trigger at, from `1` to `31`. If a month doesn't have this day, the node won't trigger. For example, if you enter `30` here, the node won't trigger in February.\n*   **Trigger at Hour**: Select the hour of the day to trigger the node.\n*   **Trigger at Minute**: Enter the minute past the hour to trigger the node when it runs, from `0` to `59`.\n\nFor example, if you enter `3` **Months Between Triggers**, `28` **Trigger at Day of Month**, **9am** for **Trigger at Hour**, and `0` **Trigger at Minute**, the node will run each quarter on the 28th day of the month at 9:00 AM.\n\n### Custom (Cron) interval[#](#custom-cron-interval \"Permanent link\")\n\nEnter a custom cron **Expression** to set the schedule for the trigger.\n\nTo generate a Cron expression, you can use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/). Paste the Cron expression that you generated using crontab guru in the **Expression** field in n8n.\n\n#### Examples[#](#examples \"Permanent link\")\n\n| Type | Cron Expression | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Every X Seconds | `*/10 * * * * *` | Every 10 seconds. |\n| Every X Minutes | `*/5 * * * *` | Every 5 minutes. |\n| Hourly | `0 * * * *` | Every hour on the hour. |\n| Daily | `0 6 * * *` | At 6:00 AM every day. |\n| Weekly | `0 12 * * 1` | At noon every Monday. |\n| Monthly | `0 0 1 * *` | At midnight on the 1st of every month. |\n| Every X Days | `0 0 */3 * *` | At midnight every 3rd day. |\n| Only Weekdays | `0 9 * * 1-5` | At 9:00 AM Monday through Friday. |\n| Custom Hourly Range | `0 9-17 * * *` | Every hour from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day. |\n| Quarterly | `0 0 1 1,4,7,10 *` | At midnight on the 1st of January, April, July, and October. |\n\n#### Why there are six asterisks in the Cron expression[#](#why-there-are-six-asterisks-in-the-cron-expression \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe sixth asterisk in the Cron expression represents seconds. Setting this is optional. The node will execute even if you don't set the value for seconds.\n\n| (\\*) | \\*  | \\*  | \\*  | \\*  | \\*  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| (second) | minute | hour | day of month | month | day of week(Sun-Sat) |\n\n## Templates and examples[#](#templates-and-examples \"Permanent link\")\n\n[Browse Schedule Trigger integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/schedule-trigger/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\n## Common issues[#](#common-issues \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common Issues](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.scheduletrigger/common-issues/)."

It's a trigger node, which means it can start an n8n workflow. This allows services to connect to n8n and run a workflow.\n\nYou can use the Webhook node as a trigger for a workflow when you want to receive data and run a workflow based on the data. The Webhook node also supports returning the data generated at the end of a workflow. This makes it useful for build a workflow to process data and return the results, like an API endpoint.\n\nThe webhook allows you to trigger workflows from services that don't have a dedicated app trigger node.\n\n## Workflow development process[#](#workflow-development-process \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n provides different **Webhook URL**s for testing and production. The testing URL includes an option to **Listen for test event**. Refer to [Workflow development](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/workflow-development/) for more information on building, testing, and shifting your Webhook node to production.\n\n## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse these parameters to configure your node.\n\n### Webhook URLs[#](#webhook-urls \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Webhook node has two **Webhook URLs**: test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel.\n\nSelect **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.\n\n![Sample Webhook URLs in the Webhook node's Parameters tab display a Test URL and Production URL](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/webhook/webhook-urls.png)\n\nSample Webhook URLs in the Webhook node's Parameters tab\n\n*   **Test**: n8n registers a test webhook when you select **Listen for Test Event** or **Test workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the webhook URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.\n*   **Production**: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.\n\n### HTTP Method[#](#http-method \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Webhook node supports standard [HTTP Request Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods):\n\n*   DELETE\n*   GET\n*   HEAD\n*   PATCH\n*   POST\n*   PUT\n    \n    Webhook max payload\n    \n    The webhook maximum payload size is 16MB. If you're self-hosting n8n, you can change this using the [endpoint environment variable](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/endpoints/) `N8N_PAYLOAD_SIZE_MAX`.\n    \n\n### Path[#](#path \"Permanent link\")\n\nBy default, this field contains a randomly generated webhook URL path, to avoid conflicts with other webhook nodes.\n\nYou can manually specify a URL path, including adding route parameters. For example, you may need to do this if you use n8n to prototype an API and want consistent endpoint URLs.\n\nThe **Path** field can take the following formats:\n\n*   `/:variable`\n*   `/path/:variable`\n*   `/:variable/path`\n*   `/:variable1/path/:variable2`\n*   `/:variable1/:variable2`\n\n### Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can require authentication for any service calling your webhook URL.

The available options depend on your node parameters. Refer to the table for option availability.\n\n*   **Allowed Origins (CORS)**: Set the permitted cross-origin domains. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests. Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.\n*   **Binary Property**: Enabling this setting allows the Webhook node to receive binary data, such as an image or audio file. Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to.\n*   **Ignore Bots**: Ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers.\n*   **IP(s) Whitelist**: Enable this to limit who (or what) can invoke a Webhook trigger URL.

Select **Listen for test event** to register the webhook before sending the data to the test webhook. The test webhook stays active for 120 seconds.\n\nWhen using the Webhook node on localhost on a [self-hosted](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/) n8n instance, run n8n in tunnel mode:\n\n*   [npm with tunnel](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/#n8n-with-tunnel)\n*   [Docker with tunnel](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/#n8n-with-tunnel)\n\n## Production workflows[#](#production-workflows \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen your workflow is ready, switch to using the **Production** webhook URL.

When another linked workflow fails, this node gets details about the failed workflow and the errors, and runs the error workflow.\n\n## Usage[#](#usage \"Permanent link\")\n\n1.  Create a new workflow, with the Error Trigger as the first node.\n2.  Give the workflow a name, for example `Error Handler`.\n3.  Select **Save**.\n4.  In the workflow where you want to use this error workflow:\n    1.  Select **Options** ![Options menu icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/three-dot-options-menu.png) > **Settings**.\n    2.  In **Error workflow**, select the workflow you just created. For example, if you used the name Error Handler, select **Error handler**.\n    3.  Select **Save**. Now, when this workflow errors, the related error workflow runs.\n\nNote the following:\n\n*   If a workflow uses the Error Trigger node, you don't have to activate the workflow.\n*   If a workflow contains the Error Trigger node, by default, the workflow uses itself as the error workflow.\n*   You can't test error workflows when running workflows manually. The Error Trigger only runs when an automatic workflow errors.\n\n## Templates and examples[#](#templates-and-examples \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can use the [Stop And Error](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.stopanderror/) node to send custom messages to the Error Trigger.\n\nRead more about [Error workflows](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/error-handling/) in n8n workflows.\n\n## Error data[#](#error-data \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe default error data received by the Error Trigger is:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19 | `[ \t{ \t\t\"execution\": { \t\t\t\"id\": \"231\", \t\t\t\"url\": \"https://n8n.example.com/execution/231\", \t\t\t\"retryOf\": \"34\", \t\t\t\"error\": { \t\t\t\t\"message\": \"Example Error Message\", \t\t\t\t\"stack\": \"Stacktrace\" \t\t\t}, \t\t\t\"lastNodeExecuted\": \"Node With Error\", \t\t\t\"mode\": \"manual\" \t\t}, \t\t\"workflow\": { \t\t\t\"id\": \"1\", \t\t\t\"name\": \"Example Workflow\" \t\t} \t} ]` |\n\nAll information is always present, except:\n\n*   `execution.id`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.\n*   `execution.url`: requires the execution to be saved in the database. Not present if the error is in the trigger node of the main workflow, as the workflow doesn't execute.\n*   `execution.retryOf`: only present when the execution is a retry of a failed execution.\n\nIf the error is caused by the trigger node of the main workflow, rather than a later stage, the data sent to the error workflow is different. There's less information in `execution{}` and more in `trigger{}`:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22 | `{   \"trigger\": {     \"error\": {       \"context\": {},       \"name\": \"WorkflowActivationError\",       \"cause\": {         \"message\": \"\",         \"stack\": \"\"       },       \"timestamp\": 1654609328787,       \"message\": \"\",       \"node\": {         . . .        }     },     \"mode\": \"trigger\"   },   \"workflow\": {     \"id\": \"\",     \"name\": \"\"   } }` |"

This error most often occurs because:\n\n*   You're using an invalid name or value in a **Query Parameter**.\n*   You're passing array values in a **Query Parameter** but the array isn't formatted correctly. Try using the [**Array Format in Query Parameters**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/#array-format-in-query-parameters) option.\n\nReview the API documentation for your service to format your query parameters.\n\n## The resource you are requesting could not be found[#](#the-resource-you-are-requesting-could-not-be-found \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis error displays when the endpoint **URL** you entered is invalid.\n\nThis may be due to a typo in the URL or a deprecated API. Refer to your service's API documentation to verify you have a valid endpoint.\n\n## JSON parameter need to be an valid JSON[#](#json-parameter-need-to-be-an-valid-json \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis error displays when you've passed a parameter as JSON and it's not formatted as valid JSON.\n\nTo resolve, review the JSON you've entered for these issues:\n\n*   Test your JSON in a JSON checker or syntax parser to find errors like missing quotation marks, extra or missing commas, incorrectly formatted arrays, extra or missing square brackets or curly brackets, and so on.\n*   If you've used an **Expression** in the node, be sure you've wrapped the entire JSON in double curly brackets, for example:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `{{     {     \"myjson\":     {         \"name1\": \"value1\",         \"name2\": \"value2\",         \"array1\":             [\"value1\",\"value2\"]     }     } }}` |\n    \n\n## Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials[#](#forbidden-perhaps-check-your-credentials \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis error displays when the node receives a 403 error indicating authentication failed.\n\nTo resolve, review the selected credentials and make sure you can authenticate with them. You may need to:\n\n*   Update permissions or scopes so that your API key or account can perform the operation you've selected.\n*   Format your generic credential in a different way.\n*   Generate a new API key or token with the appropriate permissions or scopes.\n\n## 429 - The service is receiving too many requests from you[#](#429-the-service-is-receiving-too-many-requests-from-you \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis error displays when the node receives a [429 error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) from the service that you're calling. This often means that you have hit the rate limits of that service. You can find out more on the [Handling API rate limits](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/rate-limits/) page.\n\nTo resolve the error, you can use one of the built-in options of the HTTP request node:\n\n### Batching[#](#batching \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse this option to send requests in batches and introduce a delay between them.\n\n1.  In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option > Batching**.\n2.  Set **Items per Batch** to the number of input items to include in each request.\n3.  Set **Batch Interval (ms)** to introduce a delay between requests in milliseconds. For example, to send one request to an API per second, set **Batch Interval (ms)** to `1000`.\n\n### Retry on Fail[#](#retry-on-fail \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse this option to retry the node after a failed attempt.\n\n1.  In the HTTP Request node, go to **Settings** and enable **Retry on Fail**.\n2.  Set **Max Tries** to the maximum number of times n8n should retry the node.\n3.  Set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to the desired delay in milliseconds between retries. For example, to wait one second before retrying the request again, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000`."

This section applies to workflows using the **v0 (legacy)** workflow execution order. By default, this is all workflows built before version 1.0. You can change the execution order in your [workflow settings](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/).\n\nIf you add a Merge node to a workflow containing an If node, it can result in both output data streams of the If node executing.\n\nOne data stream triggers the Merge node, which then goes and executes the other data stream.\n\nFor example, in the screenshot below there's a workflow containing an Edit Fields node, If node, and Merge node. The standard If node behavior is to execute one data stream (in the screenshot, this is the **true** output). However, due to the Merge node, both data streams execute, despite the If node not sending any data down the **false** data stream.\n\n![Screenshot of a workflow. The workflow has an Edit Fields node, followed by an If node. It ends with a Merge node.](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/if-merge-node.png)\n\nRefer to [Splitting with conditionals](https://docs.n8n.io/flow-logic/splitting/) for more information on using conditionals to create complex logic in n8n.\n\nIf you need more than two conditional outputs, use the [Switch node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.switch/).\n\n## Available data type comparisons[#](#available-data-type-comparisons \"Permanent link\")\n\n### String[#](#string \"Permanent link\")\n\nString data type supports these comparisons:\n\n*   exists\n*   does not exist\n*   is empty\n*   is not empty\n*   is equal to\n*   is not equal to\n*   contains\n*   does not contain\n*   starts with\n*   does not start with\n*   ends with\n*   does not end with\n*   matches regex\n*   does not match regex\n\n### Number[#](#number \"Permanent link\")\n\nNumber data type supports these comparisons:\n\n*   exists\n*   does not exist\n*   is empty\n*   is not empty\n*   is equal to\n*   is not equal to\n*   is greater than\n*   is less than\n*   is greater than or equal to\n*   is less than or equal to\n\n### Date & Time[#](#date-time \"Permanent link\")\n\nDate & Time data type supports these comparisons:\n\n*   exists\n*   does not exist\n*   is empty\n*   is not empty\n*   is equal to\n*   is not equal to\n*   is after\n*   is before\n*   is after or equal to\n*   is before or equal to\n\n### Boolean[#](#boolean \"Permanent link\")\n\nBoolean data type supports these comparisons:\n\n*   exists\n*   does not exist\n*   is empty\n*   is not empty\n*   is true\n*   is false\n*   is equal to\n*   is not equal to\n\n### Array[#](#array \"Permanent link\")\n\nArray data type supports these comparisons:\n\n*   exists\n*   does not exist\n*   is empty\n*   is not empty\n*   contains\n*   does not contain\n*   length equal to\n*   length not equal to\n*   length greater than\n*   length less than\n*   length greater than or equal to\n*   length less than or equal to\n\n### Object[#](#object \"Permanent link\")\n\nObject data type supports these comparisons:\n\n*   exists\n*   does not exist\n*   is empty\n*   is not empty"

Refer to the IANA [Media types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) documentation for a full list of MIME content types.\n*   **Body**: Enter the raw body content to send.\n\nRefer to your service's API documentation for detailed guidance.\n\n## Node options[#](#node-options \"Permanent link\")\n\nSelect **Add Option** to view and select these options. Options are available to all parameters unless otherwise noted.\n\n### Array Format in Query Parameters[#](#array-format-in-query-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\nOption availability\n\nThis option is only available when you turn on **Send Query Parameters**.\n\nUse this option to control the format for arrays included in query parameters. Choose from these options:\n\n*   **No Brackets**: Arrays will format as the name=value for each item in the array, for example: `foo=bar&foo=qux`.\n*   **Brackets Only**: The node adds square brackets after each array name, for example: `foo[]=bar&foo[]=qux`.\n*   **Brackets with Indices**: The node adds square brackets with an index value after each array name, for example: `foo[0]=bar&foo[1]=qux`.\n\nRefer to your service's API documentation for guidance on which option to use.\n\n### Batching[#](#batching \"Permanent link\")\n\nControl how to batch large numbers of input items:\n\n*   **Items per Batch**: Enter the number of input items to include in each batch.\n*   **Batch Interval**: Enter the time to wait between each batch of requests in milliseconds. Enter 0 for no batch interval.\n\n### Ignore SSL Issues[#](#ignore-ssl-issues \"Permanent link\")\n\nBy default, n8n only downloads the response if SSL certificate validation succeeds. If you'd like to download the response even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn this option on.\n\nChoose whether to lowercase header names (turned on, default) or not (turned off).\n\n### Redirects[#](#redirects \"Permanent link\")\n\nChoose whether to follow redirects (turned on by default) or not (turned off). If turned on, enter the maximum number of redirects the request should follow in **Max Redirects**.\n\n### Response[#](#response \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse this option to set some details about the expected API response, including:\n\n*   **Include Response Headers and Status**: By default, the node returns only the body. Turn this option on to return the full response (headers and response status code) as well as the body.\n*   **Never Error**: By default, the node returns success only when the response returns with a 2xx code. Turn this option on to return success regardless of the code returned.\n*   **Response Format**: Select the format in which the data gets returned. Choose from:\n    *   **Autodetect** (default): The node detects and formats the response based on the data returned.\n    *   **File**: Select this option to put the response into a file. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in **Put Output in Field**.\n    *   **JSON**: Select this option to format the response as JSON.\n    *   **Text**: Select this option to format the response as plain text. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in **Put Output in Field**.\n\nUse this option to paginate results, useful for handling query results that are too big for the API to return in a single call.\n\nInspect the API data first\n\nSome options for pagination require knowledge of the data returned by the API you're using. Before setting up pagination, either check the API documentation, or do an API call without pagination, to see the data it returns.\n\nUnderstand pagination\n\nPagination means splitting a large set of data into multiple pages. The amount of data on each page depends on the limit you set.\n\nFor example, you make an API call to an endpoint called `/users`. The API wants to send back information on 300 users, but this is too much data for the API to send in one response.\n\nIf the API supports pagination, you can incrementally fetch the data. To do this, you call `/users` with a pagination limit, and a page number or URL to tell the API which page to send. In this example, say you use a limit of 10, and start from page 0. The API sends the first 10 users in its response. You then call the API again, increasing the page number by 1, to get the next 10 results.\n\nConfigure the pagination settings:\n\n*   **Pagination Mode**:\n    *   **Off**: Turn off pagination.\n    *   **Update a Parameter in Each Request**: Use this when you need to dynamically set parameters for each request.\n    *   **Response Contains Next URL**: Use this when the API response includes the URL of the next page. Use an expression to set **Next URL**.\n\nFor example setups, refer to [HTTP Request node cookbook | Pagination](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/http-node/pagination/).\n\nn8n provides built-in variables for working with HTTP node requests and responses when using pagination:\n\nAPI differences\n\nDifferent APIs implement pagination in different ways. Check the API documentation for the API you're using for details. You need to find out things like:\n\n*   Does the API provide the URL for the next page?\n*   Are there API-specific limits on page size or page number?\n*   The structure of the data that the API returns.\n\n### Proxy[#](#proxy \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse this option if you need to specify an HTTP proxy.\n\nEnter the **Proxy** the request should use.\n\n### Timeout[#](#timeout \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse this option to set how long the node should wait for the server to send response headers (and start the response body). The node aborts requests that exceed this value for the initial response.\n\nEnter the **Timeout** time to wait in milliseconds.\n\n## Import curl command[#](#import-curl-command \"Permanent link\")\n\n[curl](https://curl.se/) is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.\n\nYou can use curl to call REST APIs. If the API documentation of the service you want to use provides curl examples, you can copy them out of the documentation and into n8n to configure the HTTP Request node.\n\nImport a curl command:\n\n1.  From the HTTP Request node's **Parameters** tab, select **Import cURL**. The **Import cURL command** modal opens.\n2.  Paste your curl command into the text box.\n3.  Select **Import**. n8n loads the request configuration into the node fields. This overwrites any existing configuration.\n\n## Templates and examples[#](#templates-and-examples \"Permanent link\")\n\n## Common issues[#](#common-issues \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common Issues](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/common-issues/)."

  "markdown": "# Merge | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nUse the Merge node to combine data from multiple streams, once data of all streams is available.\n\nMajor changes in 0.194.0\n\nThe n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 0.194.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/4ff688642cc9ee7ca7d00987847bf4e4515da59d/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.merge.md).\n\nMinor changes in 1.49.0\n\nn8n version 1.49.0 introduced the option to add more than two inputs. Older versions only support up to two inputs. If you're running an older version and want to combine multiple inputs in these versions, use the [Code node](https://deploy-preview-2225--n8n-docs.netlify.app/code/code-node/).\n\nThe **Mode > SQL Query** feature was also added in n8n version 1.49.0 and isn't available in older versions.\n\n## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can specify how the Merge node should combine data from different data streams by choosing a **Mode**:\n\n### Append[#](#append \"Permanent link\")\n\nKeep data from all inputs. Choose a **Number of Inputs** to output items of each input, one after another. The node waits for the execution of all connected inputs.\n\n![Sample Append mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left, one with items A, B, C and one with items D, E, F. The final data source combines both and lists A, B, C, D, E, F.](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/append-diagram.png)\n\nAppend mode inputs and output\n\n### Combine[#](#combine \"Permanent link\")\n\nCombine data from two inputs. Select an option in **Combine By** to determine how you want to merge the input data.\n\n#### Matching Fields[#](#matching-fields \"Permanent link\")\n\nCompare items by field values. Enter the fields you want to compare in **Fields to Match**.\n\nn8n's default behavior is to keep matching items. You can change this using the **Output Type** setting:\n\n*   **Keep Matches**: Merge items that match. This is like an inner join.\n*   **Keep Non-Matches**: Merge items that don't match.\n*   **Keep Everything**: Merge items together that do match and include items that don't match. This is like an outer join.\n*   **Enrich Input 1**: Keep all data from Input 1, and add matching data from Input 2. This is like a left join.\n*   **Enrich Input 2**: Keep all data from Input 2, and add matching data from Input 1. This is like a right join.\n\n![Sample Combine mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left. The final data source combines these data sources by matching fields.](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/merge-by-field-diagram.png)\n\nCombine by Matching Fields mode inputs and output\n\n#### Position[#](#position \"Permanent link\")\n\nCombine items based on their order. The item at index 0 in Input 1 merges with the item at index 0 in Input 2, and so on.\n\n![Sample Combine mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left. The final data source combines these data sources by index position.](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/merge-by-position-diagram.png)\n\nCombine by Position mode inputs and output\n\n#### All Possible Combinations[#](#all-possible-combinations \"Permanent link\")\n\nOutput all possible item combinations, while merging fields with the same name.\n\n![Sample Combine mode inputs and output. Two separate data sources are on the left. The final data source combines these data sources by all possible combinations.](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/multiplex-diagram.png)\n\nCombine by All Possible Combinations mode inputs and output\n\n#### Combine mode options[#](#combine-mode-options \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen merging data by **Mode > Combine**, you can set these **Options**:\n\n*   **Clash Handling**: Choose how to merge when data streams clash, or when there are sub-fields. Refer to [Clash handling](#clash-handling) for details.\n*   **Fuzzy Compare**: Whether to tolerate type differences when comparing fields (enabled), or not (disabled, default). For example, when you enable this, n8n treats `\"3\"` and `3` as the same.\n*   **Disable Dot Notation**: This prevents accessing child fields using `parent.child` in the field name.\n*   **Multiple Matches**: Choose how n8n handles multiple matches when comparing data streams.\n    *   **Include All Matches**: Output multiple items if there are multiple matches, one for each match.\n    *   **Include First Match Only**: Keep the first item per match and discard the remaining multiple matches.\n*   **Include Any Unpaired Items**: Choose whether to keep or discard unpaired items when merging by position. The default behavior is to leave out the items without a match.\n\n##### Clash Handling[#](#clash-handling \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf multiple items at an index have a field with the same name, this is a clash. For example, if all items in both Input 1 and Input 2 have a field named `language`, these fields clash. By default, n8n prioritizes Input 2, meaning if `language` has a value in Input 2, n8n uses that value when merging the items.\n\nYou can change this behavior by selecting **Options** > **Clash Handling**:\n\n*   **When Field Values Clash**: Choose which input to prioritize, or choose **Always Add Input Number to Field Names** to keep all fields and values, with the input number appended to the field name to show which input it came from.\n*   **Merging Nested Fields**\n    *   **Deep Merge**: Merge properties at all levels of the items, including nested objects. This is useful when dealing with complex, nested data structures where you need to ensure the merging of all levels of nested properties.\n    *   **Shallow Merge**: Merge properties at the top level of the items only, without merging nested objects. This is useful when you have flat data structures or when you only need to merge top-level properties without worrying about nested properties.\n\n### SQL Query[#](#sql-query \"Permanent link\")\n\nWrite a custom SQL Query to merge the data.\n\nExample:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `SELECT * FROM input1 LEFT JOIN input2 ON input1.name = input2.id` |\n\nData from previous nodes are available as tables and you can use them in the SQL query as input1, input2, input3, and so on, based on their order. Refer to [AlaSQL GitHub page](https://github.com/alasql/alasql/wiki/Supported-SQL-statements) for a full list of supported SQL statements.\n\n### Choose Branch[#](#choose-branch \"Permanent link\")\n\nChoose which input to keep. This option always waits until the data from both inputs is available. You can choose to **Output**:\n\n*   The **Input 1 Data**\n*   The **Input 2 Data**\n*   **A Single, Empty Item**\n\nThe node outputs the data from the chosen input, without changing it.\n\n## Templates and examples[#](#templates-and-examples \"Permanent link\")\n\n## Merging data streams with uneven numbers of items[#](#merging-data-streams-with-uneven-numbers-of-items \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe items passed into Input 1 of the Merge node will take precedence. For example, if the Merge node receives five items in Input 1 and 10 items in Input 2, it only processes five items. The remaining five items from Input 2 aren't processed.\n\n## Branch execution with If and Merge nodes[#](#branch-execution-with-if-and-merge-nodes \"Permanent link\")\n\n0.236.0 and below\n\nn8n removed this execution behavior in version 1.0. This section applies to workflows using the **v0 (legacy)** workflow execution order. By default, this is all workflows built before version 1.0. You can change the execution order in your [workflow settings](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/).\n\nIf you add a Merge node to a workflow containing an If node, it can result in both output data streams of the If node executing.\n\nOne data stream triggers the Merge node, which then goes and executes the other data stream.\n\nFor example, in the screenshot below there's a workflow containing an Edit Fields node, If node, and Merge node. The standard If node behavior is to execute one data stream (in the screenshot, this is the **true** output). However, due to the Merge node, both data streams execute, despite the If node not sending any data down the **false** data stream.\n\n![Screenshot of a workflow. The workflow has an Edit Fields node, followed by an If node. It ends with a Merge node.](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/merge/if-merge-node.png)\n\n## Try it out: A step by step example[#](#try-it-out-a-step-by-step-example \"Permanent link\")\n\nCreate a workflow with some example input data to try out the Merge node.\n\n### Set up sample data using the Code nodes[#](#set-up-sample-data-using-the-code-nodes \"Permanent link\")\n\n1.  Add a Code node to the canvas and connect it to the Start node.\n2.  Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the **JavaScript Code** field:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    | 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20 | `return [   {     json: {       name: 'Stefan',       language: 'de',     }   },   {     json: {       name: 'Jim',       language: 'en',     }   },   {     json: {       name: 'Hans',       language: 'de',     }   } ];` |\n    \n3.  Add a second Code node, and connect it to the Start node.\n4.  Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the **JavaScript Code** field:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    | 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14 | `return [ \t  {     json: {       greeting: 'Hello',       language: 'en',     }   },   {     json: {       greeting: 'Hallo',       language: 'de',     }   } ];` |\n    \n\n### Try out different merge modes[#](#try-out-different-merge-modes \"Permanent link\")\n\nAdd the Merge node. Connect the first Code node to **Input 1**, and the second Code node to **Input 2**. Run the workflow to load data into the Merge node.\n\nThe final workflow should look like this:\n\nNow try different options in **Mode** to see how it affects the output data.\n\n#### Append[#](#append_1 \"Permanent link\")\n\nSelect **Mode** > **Append**, then select **Test step**.\n\nYour output in table view should look like this:\n\n| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stefan | de  |     |\n| Jim | en  |     |\n| Hans | de  |     |\n|     | en  | Hello |\n|     | de  | Hallo |\n\n#### Combine by Matching Fields[#](#combine-by-matching-fields \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can merge these two data inputs so that each person gets the correct greeting for their language.\n\n1.  Select **Mode** > **Combine**.\n2.  Select **Combine by** > **Matching Fields**.\n3.  In both **Input 1 Field** and **Input 2 Field**, enter `language`. This tells n8n to combine the data by matching the values in the `language` field in each data set.\n4.  Select **Test step**.\n\nYour output in table view should look like this:\n\n| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stefan | de  | Hallo |\n| Jim | en  | Hello |\n| Hans | de  | Hallo |\n\n#### Combine by Position[#](#combine-by-position \"Permanent link\")\n\nSelect **Mode** > **Combine**, **Combine by** > **Position**, then select **Test step**.\n\nYour output in table view should look like this:\n\n| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stefan | en  | Hello |\n| Jim | de  | Hallo |\n\n##### Keep unpaired items[#](#keep-unpaired-items \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you want to keep all items, select **Add Option** > **Include Any Unpaired Items**, then turn on **Include Any Unpaired Items**.\n\nYour output in table view should look like this:\n\n| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stefan | en  | Hello |\n| Jim | de  | Hallo |\n| Hans | de  |     |\n\n#### Combine by All Possible Combinations[#](#combine-by-all-possible-combinations \"Permanent link\")\n\nSelect **Mode** > **Combine**, **Combine by** > **All Possible Combinations**, then select **Test step**.\n\nYour output in table view should look like this:\n\n| **name** | **language** | **greeting** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stefan | en  | Hello |\n| Stefan | de  | Hallo |\n| Jim | en  | Hello |\n| Jim | de  | Hallo |\n| Hans | en  | Hello |\n| Hans | de  | Hallo |"

Select **Add Embeds** to set extra fields including Description, Author, Title, URL, and URL Image.\n\nTo add fields that aren't included by default, set **Input Method** to **Raw JSON**. From here, add a JSON object to the **Value** parameter defining the [field names](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/message#embed-object) and values you want to include.\n\nFor example, to include `footer` and `fields`, neither of which are available using the **Enter Fields** Input Method, you could use a JSON object like this:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14 | `{     \"author\": \"My Name\", \t\"url\": \"https://discord.js.org\", \t\"fields\": [ \t\t{ \t\t\t\"name\": \"Regular field title\", \t\t\t\"value\": \"Some value here\" \t\t} \t], \t\"footer\": { \t\t\"text\": \"Some footer text here\", \t\t\"icon_url\": \"https://i.imgur.com/AfFp7pu.png\" \t} }` |\n\nYou can learn more about embeds in [Using Webhooks and Embeds | Discord](https://discord.com/safety/using-webhooks-and-embeds).\n\nIf you experience issues when working with embeds with the Discord node, you can use the [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) with your existing Discord credentials to `POST` to the following URL:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `https://discord.com/api/v10/channels/<CHANNEL_ID>/messages` |\n\nIn the body, include your embed information in the message content like this:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19 | `{ \t\"content\": \"Test\", \t\"embeds\": [ \t\t{ \t\t\t\"author\": \"My Name\", \t\t\t\"url\": \"https://discord.js.org\", \t\t\t\"fields\": [ \t\t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Regular field title\", \t\t\t\t\t\"value\": \"Some value here\" \t\t\t\t} \t\t\t], \t\t\t\"footer\": { \t\t\t\t\"text\": \"Some footer text here\", \t\t\t\t\"icon_url\": \"https://i.imgur.com/AfFp7pu.png\" \t\t\t} \t\t} \t] }` |\n\n## Mention users and channels[#](#mention-users-and-channels \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo mention users and channels in Discord messages, you need to format your message according to [Discord's message formatting guidelines](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#message-formatting).\n\nTo mention a user, you need to know the Discord user's user ID. Keep in mind that the user ID is different from the user's display name. Similarly, you need a channel ID to link to a specific channel.\n\nYou can learn how to enable developer mode and copy the user or channel IDs in [Discord's documentation on finding User/Server/Message IDs](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID).\n\nOnce you have the user or channel ID, you can format your message with the following syntax:\n\n*   **User**: `<@USER_ID>`\n*   **Channel**: `<#CHANNEL_ID>`\n*   **Role**: `<@&ROLE_ID>`"

To avoid this, you can create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate.\n\nIf you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in [Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/reference/errors/authorization#google_hasnt_verified_this_app).\n\nFor Google Cloud apps with **Publishing status** set to **Testing** and **User type** set to **External**, consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to [Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615?hl=en#zippy=%2Ctesting) for more information. To resolve this, reconnect the app in the n8n credentials modal.\n\n## Google Drive OAuth error[#](#google-drive-oauth-error \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf using the OAuth authentication method, you may see an error indicating that you can't sign in because the app doesn't meet Google's expectations for keeping apps secure.\n\nMost often, the actual cause of this issue is that the URLs don't match between Google's OAuth configuration and n8n. To avoid this, start by reviewing any links included in Google's error message. This will contain details about the exact error that occurred.\n\nIf you are self-hostin n8n, check the n8n configuration items used to construct external URLs. Verify that the [`N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL`](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) and [`WEBHOOK_URL`](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/) environment variables use fully qualified domains.\n\n## Get recent files from Google Drive[#](#get-recent-files-from-google-drive \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo retrieve recent files from Google Drive, you need to sort files by modification time. To do this, you need to search for existing files and retrieve their modification times. Next you can sort the files to find the most recent file and use another Google Drive node target the file by ID.\n\nThe process looks like this:\n\n1.  Add a **Google Drive** node to your canvas.\n2.  Select the **File/Folder** resource and the **Search** operation.\n3.  Enable **Return All** to sort through all files.\n4.  Set the **What to Search** filter to **Files**.\n5.  In the **Options**, set the **Fields** to **All**.\n6.  Connect a **Sort** node to the output of the **Google Drive** node.\n7.  Choose **Simple** sort type.\n8.  Enter `modifiedTime` as the **Field Name** in the **Fields To Sort By** section.\n9.  Choose **Descending** sort order.\n10.  Add a **Limit** node to the output of the **Sort** node.\n11.  Set **Max Items** to **1** to keep the most recent file.\n12.  Connect another **Google Drive** node to the output of the **Limit** node.\n13.  Select **File** as the **Resource** and the operation of your choice.\n14.  In the **File** selection, choose **By ID**.\n15.  Select **Expression** and enter `{{ $json.id }}` as the expression."

It also lets you select the naming pattern, and the file size to download (if available - typically for images).\n*   Formatting options perform some reformatting as described in [About reformatting](#about-reformatting).\n\n#### About reformatting[#](#about-reformatting \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe default JSON format for KoboToolbox submission data is sometimes hard to deal with, because it's not schema-aware, and all fields are therefore returned as strings.\n\nThis node provides a lightweight opinionated reformatting logic, enabled with the **Reformat?** parameter, available on all operations that return form submissions: the submission query, get, and the attachment download operations.\n\nWhen enabled, the reformatting:\n\n*   Reorganizes the JSON into a multi-level hierarchy following the form's groups. By default, question grouping hierarchy is materialized by a `/` character in the field names, for example `Group1/Question1`. With reformatting enabled, n8n reorganizes these into `Group1.Question1`, as nested JSON objects.\n*   Renames fields to trim `_` (not supported by many downstream systems).\n*   Parses all geospatial fields (Point, Line, and Area question types) into their standard GeoJSON equivalent.\n*   Splits all fields matching any of the **Multiselect Mask** wildcard masks into an array. Since the multi-select fields appear as space-separated strings, they can't be guessed algorithmically, so you must provide a field naming mask. Format the masks as a comma-separated list. Lists support the `*` wildcard.\n*   Converts all fields matching any of the **Number Mask** wildcard masks into a JSON float.\n\nHere's a detailed example in JSON:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26 | `{   \"_id\": 471987,   \"formhub/uuid\": \"189436bb09a54957bfcc798e338b54d6\",   \"start\": \"2021-12-05T16:13:38.527+02:00\",   \"end\": \"2021-12-05T16:15:33.407+02:00\",   \"Field_Details/Field_Name\": \"Test Fields\",   \"Field_Details/Field_Location\": \"-1.932914 30.078211 1421 165\",   \"Field_Details/Field_Shape\": \"-1.932914 30.078211 1421 165;-1.933011 30.078085 0 0;-1.933257 30.078004 0 0;-1.933338 30.078197 0 0;-1.933107 30.078299 0 0;-1.932914 30.078211 1421 165\",   \"Field_Details/Crops_Grown\": \"maize beans avocado\",   \"Field_Details/Field_Size_sqm\": \"2300\",   \"__version__\": \"veGcULpqP6JNFKRJbbMvMs\",   \"meta/instanceID\": \"uuid:2356cbbe-c1fd-414d-85c8-84f33e92618a\",   \"_xform_id_string\": \"ajXVJpBkTD5tB4Nu9QXpgm\",   \"_uuid\": \"2356cbbe-c1fd-414d-85c8-84f33e92618a\",   \"_attachments\": [],   \"_status\": \"submitted_via_web\",   \"_geolocation\": [     -1.932914,     30.078211   ],   \"_submission_time\": \"2021-12-05T14:15:44\",   \"_tags\": [],   \"_notes\": [],   \"_validation_status\": {},   \"_submitted_by\": null }` |\n\nWith reformatting enabled, and the appropriate masks for multi-select and number formatting (for example, `Crops_*` and `*_sqm` respectively), n8n parses it into:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29<br>30<br>31<br>32<br>33<br>34<br>35<br>36<br>37<br>38<br>39<br>40<br>41<br>42<br>43<br>44<br>45<br>46<br>47<br>48<br>49<br>50<br>51<br>52<br>53<br>54<br>55<br>56<br>57<br>58<br>59<br>60<br>61<br>62<br>63<br>64<br>65<br>66<br>67 | `{   \"id\": 471987,   \"formhub\": {     \"uuid\": \"189436bb09a54957bfcc798e338b54d6\"   },   \"start\": \"2021-12-05T16:13:38.527+02:00\",   \"end\": \"2021-12-05T16:15:33.407+02:00\",   \"Field_Details\": {     \"Field_Name\": \"Test Fields\",     \"Field_Location\": {       \"lat\": -1.932914,       \"lon\": 30.078211     },     \"Field_Shape\": {       \"type\": \"polygon\",       \"coordinates\": [         {           \"lat\": -1.932914,           \"lon\": 30.078211         },         {           \"lat\": -1.933011,           \"lon\": 30.078085         },         {           \"lat\": -1.933257,           \"lon\": 30.078004         },         {           \"lat\": -1.933338,           \"lon\": 30.078197         },         {           \"lat\": -1.933107,           \"lon\": 30.078299         },         {           \"lat\": -1.932914,           \"lon\": 30.078211         }       ]     },     \"Crops_Grown\": [       \"maize\",       \"beans\",       \"avocado\"     ],     \"Field_Size_sqm\": 2300   },   \"version\": \"veGcULpqP6JNFKRJbbMvMs\",   \"meta\": {     \"instanceID\": \"uuid:2356cbbe-c1fd-414d-85c8-84f33e92618a\"   },   \"xform_id_string\": \"ajXVJpBkTD5tB4Nu9QXpgm\",   \"uuid\": \"2356cbbe-c1fd-414d-85c8-84f33e92618a\",   \"attachments\": [],   \"status\": \"submitted_via_web\",   \"geolocation\": {     \"lat\": -1.932914,     \"lon\": 30.078211   },   \"submission_time\": \"2021-12-05T14:15:44\",   \"tags\": [],   \"notes\": [],   \"validation_status\": {},   \"submitted_by\": null }` |\n\n## What to do if your operation isn't supported[#](#what-to-do-if-your-operation-isnt-supported \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the [HTTP Request node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the service's API.\n\nYou can use the credential you created for this service in the HTTP Request node:\n\n1.

This works for tables where single column values can uniquely identify individual rows.\n\nYou can't use this pattern for tables that use [composite keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_key), where you need multiple columns to uniquely identify a row. A example of this is MySQL's [`user` table](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mysql-user-table/) in the `mysql` database, where you need both the `user` and `host` columns to uniquely identify rows.\n\nTo update tables with composite keys, write the query manually with the **Execute SQL** operation instead. There, you can match on multiple values, like in this example which matches on both `customer_id` and `product_id`:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `UPDATE orders SET quantity = 3 WHERE customer_id = 538 AND product_id = 800;` |\n\n## Can't connect to a local MySQL server when using Docker[#](#cant-connect-to-a-local-mysql-server-when-using-docker \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen you run either n8n or MySQL in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to MySQL.\n\nThe solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.\n\n### If only MySQL is in Docker[#](#if-only-mysql-is-in-docker \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf only MySQL is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).\n\nWhen running the container, [publish the port](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, MySQL runs on port 3306, so your Docker command should look like this:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `docker run -p 3306:3306 --name my-mysql -d mysql:latest` |\n\nWhen configuring [MySQL credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **Host** to `localhost`).\n\n### If only n8n is in Docker[#](#if-only-n8n-is-in-docker \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf only n8n is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.\n\nIf you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux**, use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n` |\n\nIf you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.\n\nWhen configuring [MySQL credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql/), use `host.docker.internal` as the **Host** address instead of `localhost`.\n\n### If MySQL and n8n are running in separate Docker containers[#](#if-mysql-and-n8n-are-running-in-separate-docker-containers \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf both n8n and MySQL are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.\n\nConfigure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way). Add both the MySQL and n8n containers to the same [user-defined bridge network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/).\n\nWhen configuring [MySQL credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql/), use the MySQL container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the MySQL container `my-mysql`, you would set the **Host** to `my-mysql`.\n\n### If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container[#](#if-mysql-and-n8n-are-running-in-the-same-docker-container \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure MySQL to listen on `localhost` and configure the **Host** in the [MySQL credentials in n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to use `localhost`.\n\n## Decimal numbers returned as strings[#](#decimal-numbers-returned-as-strings \"Permanent link\")\n\nBy default, the MySQL node returns [`DECIMAL` values](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/fixed-point-types.html) as strings. This is done intentionally to avoid loss of precision that can occur due to limitation with the way JavaScript represents numbers. You can learn more about the decision in the documentation for the [MySQL library](https://sidorares.github.io/node-mysql2/docs/api-and-configurations) that n8n uses.\n\nTo output decimal values as numbers instead of strings and ignore the risks in loss of precision, enable the **Output Decimals as Numbers** option. This will output the values as numbers instead of strings.\n\nAs an alternative, you can manually convert from the string to a decimal using the [`toFloat()` function](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/strings/#string-toFloat) with [`toFixed()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed) or with the [Edit Fields (Set) node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) after the MySQL node. Be aware that you may still need to account for a potential loss of precision."

Refer to [OpenAI](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.openai/) for more information on the OpenAI node itself.\n\n## Message a Model[#](#message-a-model \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse this operation to send a message or prompt to an OpenAI model and receive a response.\n\nEnter these parameters:\n\n*   **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [OpenAI credential](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/).\n*   **Resource**: Select **Text**.\n*   **Operation**: Select **Message a Model**.\n*   **Model**: Select the model you want to use. If you’re not sure which model to use, try `gpt-4o` if you need high intelligence or `gpt-4o-mini` if you need the fastest speed and lowest cost. Refer to [Models overview | OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) for more information.\n*   **Messages**: Enter a **Text** prompt and assign a **Role** that the model will use to generate responses. Refer to [Prompt engineering | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) for more information on how to write a better prompt by using these roles. Choose from one of these roles:\n    *   **User**: Sends a message as a user and gets a response from the model.\n    *   **Assistant**: Tells the model to adopt a specific tone or personality.\n    *   **System**: By default, the system message is `\"You are a helpful assistant\"`. You can define instructions in the user message, but the instructions set in the system message are more effective. You can only set one system message per conversation. Use this to set the model's behavior or context for the next user message.\n*   **Simplify Output**: Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data.\n*   **Output Content as JSON**: Turn on to attempt to return the response in JSON format. Compatible with `GPT-4 Turbo` and all `GPT-3.5 Turbo` models newer than `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`.\n\n### Options[#](#options \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **Frequency Penalty**: Apply a penalty to reduce the model's tendency to repeat similar lines. The range is between `0.0` and `2.0`.\n*   **Maximum Number of Tokens**: Set the maximum number of tokens for the response. One token is roughly four characters for standard English text. Use this to limit the length of the output.\n*   **Number of Completions**: Defaults to 1. Set the number of completions you want to generate for each prompt. Use carefully since setting a high number will quickly consume your tokens.\n*   **Presence Penalty**: Apply a penalty to influence the model to discuss new topics. The range is between `0.0` and `2.0`.\n*   **Output Randomness (Temperature)**: Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between `0.0` (deterministic) and `1.0` (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Top P)** but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around `0.7`) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they’re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. Defaults to `1.0`.\n*   **Output Randomness (Top P)**: Adjust the Top P setting to control the diversity of the assistant's responses. For example, `0.5` means half of all likelihood-weighted options are considered. We recommend altering this or **Output Randomness (Temperature)** but not both. Defaults to `1.0`.\n\nRefer to [Message a Model | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/text-completion/create) documentation for more information.\n\n## Classify Text for Violations[#](#classify-text-for-violations \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse this operation to identify and flag content that might be harmful. OpenAI model will analyze the text and return a response containing:\n\n*   `flagged`: A boolean field indicating if the content is potentially harmful.\n*   `categories`: A list of category-specific violation flags.\n*   `category_scores`: Scores for each category.\n\nEnter these parameters:\n\n*   **Credential to connect with**: Create or select an existing [OpenAI credential](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/openai/).\n*   **Resource**: Select **Text**.\n*   **Operation**: Select **Classify Text for Violations**.\n*   **Text Input**: Enter text to classify if it violates the moderation policy.\n*   **Simplify Output**: Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data.\n\n### Options[#](#options_1 \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **Use Stable Model**: Turn on to use the stable version of the model instead of the latest version, accuracy may be slightly lower.\n\nRefer to [Moderations | OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/moderations) documentation for more information.\n\n## Common issues[#](#common-issues \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor common errors or issues and suggested resolution steps, refer to [Common Issues](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.openai/common-issues/)."

You can find the trigger node docs [here](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgrestrigger/).\n\n## Use query parameters[#](#use-query-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen creating a query to run on a Postgres database, you can use the **Query Parameters** field in the **Options** section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.\n\nFor example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12 | `[     {         \"email\": \"alex@example.com\",         \"name\": \"Alex\",         \"age\": 21      },     {         \"email\": \"jamie@example.com\",         \"name\": \"Jamie\",         \"age\": 33      } ]` |\n\nYou can write a query like:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `SELECT * FROM $1:name WHERE email = $2;` |\n\nThen in **Query Parameters**, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `// users is an example table name users, {{ $json.email }}` |\n\n## Common issues[#](#common-issues \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/common-issues/)."

  "markdown": "# Postgres node common issues | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/common-issues.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nHere are some common errors and issues with the [Postgres node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.\n\n## Dynamically populate SQL `IN` groups with parameters[#](#dynamically-populate-sql-in-groups-with-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn Postgres, you can use the SQL [`IN` comparison construct](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-comparisons.html#FUNCTIONS-COMPARISONS-IN-SCALAR) to make comparisons between groups of values:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ('small', 'medium', 'large');` |\n\nWhile you can use n8n [expressions](https://docs.n8n.io/code/expressions/) in your query to dynamically populate the values in an `IN` group, combining this with [query parameters](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/#use-query-parameters) provides extra protection by automatically sanitizing input.\n\nTo construct an `IN` group query with query parameters:\n\n1.  Set the **Operation** to **Execute Query**.\n2.  In **Options**, select **Query Parameters**.\n3.  Use an expression to select an array from the input data. For example, `{{ $json.input_shirt_sizes }}`.\n4.  In the **Query** parameter, write your query with the `IN` construct with an empty set of parentheses. For example:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ();` |\n    \n5.  Inside of the `IN` parentheses, use an expression to dynamically create index-based placeholders (like `$1`, `$2`, and `$3`) for the number of items in your query parameter array. You can do this by increasing each array index by one since the placeholder variables are 1 indexed:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `SELECT color, shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ({{ $json.input_shirt_sizes.map((i, pos) => \"$\" + (pos+1)).join(', ') }});` |\n    \n\nWith this technique, n8n automatically creates the correct number of [prepared statement placeholders](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare.html) for the `IN` values according to the number of items in your array.\n\n## Working with timestamps and time zones[#](#working-with-timestamps-and-time-zones \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo avoid complications with how n8n and Postgres interpret timestamp and time zone data, follow these general tips:\n\n*   **Use UTC when storing and passing dates**: Using UTC helps avoid confusion over timezone conversions when converting dates between different representations and systems.\n*   **Set the execution timezone**: Set the global timezone in n8n using either [environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/time-zone/) (for self-hosted) or in the [settings](https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/set-cloud-timezone/) (for n8n Cloud). You can set a workflow-specific timezone in the [workflow settings](https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/settings/).\n*   **Use ISO 8601 format**: The [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) encodes the day of the month, month, year, hour, minutes, and seconds in a standardized string. n8n passes dates between nodes as strings and uses [Luxon](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/luxon/) to parse dates. If you need to cast to ISO 8601 explicitly, you can use the [Date & Time node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.datetime/) and a custom format set to the string `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss`."

Access the metadata properties using the [Postgres `->>` arrow JSON operator](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-PROCESSING) like this (curly brackets denote components to fill in):\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `metadata->>{your-property}={comparison-operator}.{comparison-value}` |\n\nFor example to access an `age` property in the metadata and return results greater than or equal to 21, you could enter the following in the **Filters (String)** field:\n\nYou can combine these operators to construct more complex queries.\n\n## Can't connect to a local Supabase database when using Docker[#](#cant-connect-to-a-local-supabase-database-when-using-docker \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen you run Supabase in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Supabase.\n\nThe solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.\n\n### If only Supabase is in Docker[#](#if-only-supabase-is-in-docker \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf only Supabase is running in Docker, the Docker Compose file used by the [self-hosting guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) already runs Supabase bound to the correct interfaces.\n\nWhen configuring [Supabase credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/supabase/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **Host** to `localhost`).\n\n### If Supabase and n8n are running in separate Docker containers[#](#if-supabase-and-n8n-are-running-in-separate-docker-containers \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf both n8n and Supabase are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.\n\nConfigure Supabase to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official [Docker compose configuration](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) already does this this). Add both the Supabase and n8n components to the same [user-defined bridge network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/bridge/) if you aren't already managing them together in the same Docker Compose file.\n\nWhen configuring [Supabase credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/supabase/), use the Supabase API gateway container's name (`supabase-kong` by default) as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you use the default configuration, you would set the **Host** to `http://supabase-kong:8000`.\n\n## Records are accessible through Postgres but not Supabase[#](#records-are-accessible-through-postgres-but-not-supabase \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf queries for records return empty using the Supabase node, but are available through the [Postgres](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.postgres/) node or with a Postgres client, there may be a conflict with Supabase's [Row Level Security (RLS)](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) policy.\n\nSupabase always enables RLS when you create a table in a public schema with the Table Editor. When RLS is active, the API doesn't return any data with the public `anon` key until you create policies. This is a security measure to ensure that you only expose data you intend to.\n\nTo access data from a table with RLS enabled as the `anon` role, [create a policy](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security#creating-policies) to enable the access patterns you intend to use."

  "markdown": "# Notion node common issues | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notion/common-issues.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nHere are some common errors and issues with the [Notion node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notion/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.\n\n## Relation property not displaying[#](#relation-property-not-displaying \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Notion node only supports displaying the data relation property for [two-way relations](https://www.notion.com/help/relations-and-rollups). When you connect two Notion databases with a two-way relationship, you can select or filter by the relation property when working with the Notion node's **Database Page** resource.\n\nTo enable two-way relations, edit the relation property in Notion and enable the **Show on \\[name of related database\\]** option to create a reverse relation. Select a name to use for the relation in the new context. The relation is now accessible in n8n when filtering or selecting.\n\nIf you need to work with Notion databases with one-way relationship, you can use the [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) with your existing Notion credentials. For example, to update a one-way relationship, you can send a `PATCH` request to the following URL:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `https://api.notion.com/v1/pages/<page_id>` |\n\nEnable **Send Body**, set the **Body Content Type** to **JSON**, and set **Specify Body** to **Using JSON**. Afterward, you can enter a JSON object like the following into the **JSON** field:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{ \t\"properties\": { \t\t\"Account\": { \t\t\t\"relation\": [ \t\t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\t\"id\": \"<your_relation_ID>\" \t\t\t\t} \t\t\t] \t\t} \t} }` |\n\n## Create toggle heading[#](#create-toggle-heading \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Notion node allows you to create headings and toggles when adding blocks to **Page**, **Database Page**, or **Block** resources. Creating toggleable headings isn't yet supported by the Notion node itself.\n\nYou can work around this be creating a regular heading and then modifying it to enable the [`is_toggleable` property](https://developers.notion.com/reference/block#headings):\n\n1.  Add a heading with Notion node.\n2.  Select the resource you want to add a heading to:\n    *   To add a new page with a heading, select the **Page** or **Database Page** resources with the **Create** operation.\n    *   To add a heading to an existing page, select the **Block** resource with the **Append After** operation.\n3.  Select **Add Block** and set the **Type Name or ID** to either **Heading 1**, **Heading 2**, or **Heading 3**.\n4.  Add an [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node connected to the Notion node and select the `GET` method.\n5.  Set the **URL** to `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/<block_ID>`. For example, if your added the heading to an existing page, you could use the following URL: `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.results[0].id }}`. If you created a new page instead of appending a block, you may need to discover the block ID by querying the page contents first.\n6.  Select **Predefined Credential Type** and connect your existing Notion credentials.\n7.  Add an [Edit Fields (Set)](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node after the HTTP Request node.\n8.  Add `heading_1.is_toggleable` as a new **Boolean** field set to `true`. Swap `heading_1` for a different heading number as necessary.\n9.  Add a second HTTP Request node after the Edit Fields (Set) node.\n10.  Set the **Method** to `PATCH` and use `https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.id }}` as the **URL** value.\n11.  Select **Predefined Credential Type** and connect your existing Notion credentials.\n12.  Enable **Send Body** and set a parameter.\n13.  Set the parameter **Name** to `heading_1` (substitute `heading_1` for the heading level you are using).\n14.  Set the parameter **Value** to `{{ $json.heading_1 }}` (substitute `heading_1` for the heading level you are using).\n\nThe above sequence will create a regular heading block. It will query the newly created header, add the `is_toggleable` property, and update the heading block.\n\n## Handle null and empty values[#](#handle-null-and-empty-values \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou may receive a validation error when working with the Notion node if you submit fields with empty or null values. This can occur any time you populate fields from previous nodes when that data is missing.\n\nTo work around this, check for the existence of the field data before sending it to Notion or use a default value.\n\nTo check for the data before executing the Notion node, use an [If](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.if/) node to check whether the field is unset. This allows you to use the [Edit Fields (Set)](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node to conditionally remove the field when it doesn't have a valid value.\n\nAs an alternative, you can set a [default value](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/expressions/check-incoming-data/) if the incoming data doesn't provide one."

If you haven't added the bot to the channel, you'll see an error with a description like: `Error: Forbidden: bot is not a participant of the channel`.\n\nTo add a bot to a channel:\n\n1.  In the Telegram app, access the target channel and select the channel name.\n2.  Label the channel name as **public channel**.\n3.  Select **Administrators** > **Add Admin**.\n4.  Search for the bot's username and select it.\n5.  Select the checkmark on the top-right corner to add the bot to the channel.\n\n## Get the Chat ID[#](#get-the-chat-id \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can only use `@channelusername` on public channels. To interact with a Telegram group, you need that group's Chat ID.\n\nThere are three ways to get that ID:\n\n1.  From the Telegram Trigger: Use the [Telegram Trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/) node in your workflow to get a Chat ID. This node can trigger on different events and returns a Chat ID on successful execution.\n2.  From your web browser: Open Telegram in a web browser and open the group chat. The group's Chat ID is the series of digits behind the letter \"g.\" Prefix your group Chat ID with a `-` when you enter it in n8n.\n3.  Invite Telegram's [@RawDataBot](https://t.me/RawDataBot) to the group: Once you add it, the bot outputs a JSON file that includes a `chat` object. The `id` for that object is the group Chat ID. Then remove the RawDataBot from your group.\n\n## Send more than 30 messages per second[#](#send-more-than-30-messages-per-second \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Telegram API has a [limitation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#broadcasting-to-users) of sending only 30 messages per second. Follow these steps to send more than 30 messages:\n\n1.  **Loop Over Items node**: Use the [Loop Over Items](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node to get at most 30 chat IDs from your database.\n2.  **Telegram node**: Connect the Telegram node with the Loop Over Items node. Use the **Expression Editor** to select the Chat IDs from the Loop Over Items node.\n3.  **Code node**: Connect the [Code](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node with the Telegram node. Use the Code node to wait for a few seconds before fetching the next batch of chat IDs. Connect this node with the Loop Over Items node.\n\nYou can also use this [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/772).\n\n## Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages[#](#remove-the-n8n-attribution-from-sent-messages \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you're using the node to [send Telegram messages](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/message-operations/#send-message), the message automatically gets an n8n attribution appended to the end:\n\n> This message was sent automatically with n8n\n\nTo remove this attribution:\n\n1.  In the node's **Additional Fields** section, select **Add Field**.\n2.  Select **Append n8n attribution**.\n3.  Turn the toggle off.\n\nRefer to [Send Message additional fields](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegram/message-operations/#send-message-additional-fields) for more information."

It's common to see this when using the **Send Template** operation if the data you send doesn't match the format of your template.\n\nTo resolve this issue, review the parameters in your [message template](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2055875911147364?id=2129163877102343). Pay attention to each parameter's data type and the order they're defined in the template.\n\nCheck the data that n8n is mapping to the template parameters. If you're using expressions to set parameter values, check the input data to make sure each item resolves to a valid value. You may want to use the [Edit Fields (Set) node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) or [set a fallback value](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/expressions/check-incoming-data/) to ensure you send a value with the correct format.\n\n## Working with non-text media[#](#working-with-non-text-media \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe WhatsApp Business Cloud node can work with non-text messages and media like images, audio, documents, and more.\n\nIf your operation includes a **Input Data Field Name** or **Property Name** parameter, set this to the field name itself rather than referencing the data in an expression.\n\nFor example, if you are trying to send a message with an \"Image\" **MessageType** and **Take Image From** set to \"n8n\", set **Input Data Field Name** to a field name like `data` instead of an expression like `{{ $json.input.data }}`."

If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas.\n\nStuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying.\n\nTo resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support.\n\n## Date and time columns are rendering as numbers[#](#date-and-time-columns-are-rendering-as-numbers \"Permanent link\")\n\nGoogle Sheets can render dates and times a few different ways.\n\nThe [**serial number** format](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/DateTimeRenderOption), popularized by Lotus 1-2-3 and used my types of spreadsheet software, represents dates as a decimal number. The whole number component (the part left of the decimal) represents the number of days since December 30, 1899. The decimal portion (the part right of the decimal) represents time as a portion of a 24-hour period (for example, `.5` represents noon).\n\nTo use a different format for date and time values, adjust the format in your Google Sheet Trigger node. This is available when **Trigger On** is set to **Row Added**:\n\n1.  Open the Google Sheet Trigger node on your canvas.\n2.  Select **Add option**.\n3.  Select **DateTime Render**.\n4.  Change **DateTime Render** to **Formatted String**.\n\nThe Google Sheets Trigger node will now format date, time, datetime, and duration fields as strings according to their number format.\n\nThe number format depends on the spreadsheet's locale settings. You can change the local by opening the spreadsheet and selecting **File > Settings**. In the **General** tab, set **Locale** to your preferred locale. Select **Save settings** to adjust the value."

Use this parameter with the **File Made Public** and **File Shared** events.\n\n## Options[#](#options \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can further refine the node's behavior when you **Add Option**s:\n\n*   **Resolve IDs**: Whether to resolve the IDs to their respective names and return them (turned on) or not (turned off, default).\n*   **Usernames or IDs to ignore**: Select usernames or enter a comma-separated string of encoded user IDs to ignore events from.

Refer to [Slack credentials | Slack Trigger configuration](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) for more information.\n\nYou must add the appropriate scopes to your Slack app for this trigger node to work.\n\nThe node requires scopes for the [conversations.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list) and [users.list](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list) methods at minimum. Check out the [Scopes | Slack credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/#scopes) list for a more complete list of scopes.\n\n## Common issues[#](#common-issues \"Permanent link\")\n\nHere are some common errors and issues with the Slack Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.\n\n### Workflow only works in testing or production[#](#workflow-only-works-in-testing-or-production \"Permanent link\")\n\nSlack only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that you can't switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa) without reconfiguring the registered webhook URL.\n\nYou may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. Slack will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.\n\nTo work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing:\n\nHalts production traffic\n\nThis temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.\n\n1.  Go to your workflow page.\n2.  Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.\n3.  Edit the **Request URL** in your the [Slack Trigger configuration](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) to use the testing webhook URL instead of the production webhook URL.\n4.  Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.\n5.  When you finish testing, edit the **Request URL** in your the [Slack Trigger configuration](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/slack/#slack-trigger-configuration) to use the production webhook URL instead of the testing webhook URL.\n6.  Toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.\n\n### Token expired[#](#token-expired \"Permanent link\")\n\nSlack offers **token rotation** that you can turn on for bot and user tokens. This makes every tokens expire after 12 hours. While this may be useful for testing, n8n credentials using tokens with this enabled will fail after expiry. If you want to use your Slack credentials in production, this feature must be **off**.\n\nTo check if your Slack app has token rotation turned on, refer to the [Slack API Documentation | Token Rotation](https://api.slack.com/authentication/rotation).\n\nIf your app uses token rotation\n\nPlease note, if your Slack app uses token rotation, you can't turn it off again. You need to create a new Slack app with token rotation disabled instead."

  "markdown": "# Telegram Trigger node common issues\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/common-issues.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nHere are some common errors and issues with the [Telegram Trigger node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.telegramtrigger/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.\n\n## Stuck waiting for trigger event[#](#stuck-waiting-for-trigger-event \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen testing the Telegram Trigger node with the **Test step** or or **Test workflow** buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas.\n\nStuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying.\n\nTo resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support.\n\n## Bad request: bad webhook: An HTTPS URL must be provided for webhook[#](#bad-request-bad-webhook-an-https-url-must-be-provided-for-webhook \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis error occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy and there is a problem with your instance's webhook URL.\n\nWhen running n8n behind a reverse proxy, you must [configure the `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/webhook-url/) with the public URL where your n8n instance is running. For Telegram, this URL must use HTTPS.\n\nTo fix this issue, configure TLS/SSL termination in your reverse proxy. Afterward, update your `WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable to use the HTTPS address.\n\n## Workflow only works in testing or production[#](#workflow-only-works-in-testing-or-production \"Permanent link\")\n\nTelegram only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), Telegram overwrites the registered webhook URL.\n\nYou may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. The Telegram bot will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications.\n\nTo work around this, you can either disable your workflow when testing or create separate Telegram bots for testing and production.\n\nTo create a separate telegram bot for testing, repeat the process you completed to create your first bot. Reference [Telegram's bot documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots) and the [Telegram bot API reference](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) for more information.\n\nTo disable your workflow when testing, try the following:\n\nHalts production traffic\n\nThis workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated.\n\n1.  Go to your workflow page.\n2.  Toggle the **Active** switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily.\n3.  Test your workflow using the test webhook URL.\n4.  When you finish testing, toggle the **Inactive** toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working."

The AI agent's environment is everything the agent can access that isn't the agent itself, which might include customer queries, tools, or other context.\n\nThe AI Agent node gives you six LangChain agent options.\n\nOn this page, you'll find a summary of the available agents with links to more detailed pages on each, templates and examples, and links to more resources.\n\nConnect a tool\n\nYou must connect at least one tool [sub-node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/) to an AI Agent node.\n\n## Available agents[#](#available-agents \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n provides these agents:\n\n*   [**Tools Agent**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/) (default): This agent uses external tools and APIs to perform actions and retrieve information. It can understand the capabilities of different tools and determine which tool to use depending on the task. This agent helps integrate LLMs with various external services and databases.\n    \n    Begin here\n    \n    n8n recommends using this agent for most use cases. It will handle most scenarios and provides the best experience when working with [tools](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools/).\n    \n*   [**Conversational Agent**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/conversational-agent/): This agent has human-like conversations. It can maintain context, understand user intent, and provide relevant answers. This agent is typically used for building chatbots, virtual assistants and customer support systems. If your preferred AI model doesn't support tool calling or you're handling simpler interactions, this agent is a good option.\n    \n*   [**OpenAI Functions Agent**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/openai-functions-agent/): Use this agent with an [OpenAI functions model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling).

It's most useful for tasks that require a structured approach and careful planning.\n*   [**ReAct Agent**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/react-agent/): This agent reasons about a given task, determines the necessary actions, and then executes them. It follows the cycle of reasoning and acting until it completes the task. The ReAct agent can break down complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks, prioritise them, and execute them one after the other.\n    \n    No memory\n    \n    The ReAct agent doesn't support memory sub-nodes. This means it can't recall previous prompts or simulate an ongoing conversation.\n    \n*   [**SQL Agent**](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/sql-agent/): This agent uses a SQL database as a data source. It can understand natural language questions, convert them into SQL queries, execute the queries, and present the results in a user-friendly format.

  "markdown": "# Zep Vector Store node documentation\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.vectorstorezep.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nUse the Zep Vector Store to interact with Zep vector databases. You can insert documents into a vector database, get documents from a vector database, retrieve documents to provide them to a retriever connected to a chain, or connect it directly to an agent to use as a tool.\n\nOn this page, you'll find the node parameters for the Zep Vector Store node, and links to more resources.\n\nCredentials\n\nYou can find authentication information for this node [here](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/zep/).\n\nParameter resolution in sub-nodes\n\nSub-nodes behave differently to other nodes when processing multiple items using an expression.\n\nMost nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n## Node usage patterns[#](#node-usage-patterns \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can use the Zep Vector Store node in the following patterns.\n\n### Use as a regular node to insert, update, and retrieve documents[#](#use-as-a-regular-node-to-insert-update-and-retrieve-documents \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can use the Zep Vector Store as a regular node to insert or get documents. This pattern places the Zep Vector Store in the regular connection flow without using an agent.\n\nYou can see an example of this in scenario 1 of [this template](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (the example uses Supabase, but the pattern is the same).\n\n### Connect directly to an AI agent as a tool[#](#connect-directly-to-an-ai-agent-as-a-tool \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can connect the Zep Vector Store node directly to the tool connector of an [AI agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) to use vector store as a resource when answering queries.\n\nHere, the connection would be: AI agent (tools connector) -> Zep Vector Store node.\n\n### Use a retriever to fetch documents[#](#use-a-retriever-to-fetch-documents \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can use the [Vector Store Retriever](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.retrievervectorstore/) node with the Zep Vector Store node to fetch documents from the Zep Vector Store node. This is often used with the [Question and Answer Chain](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/) node to fetch documents from the vector store that match the given chat input.\n\nAn [example of the connection flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/1960-ask-questions-about-a-pdf-using-ai/) (the example uses Pinecone, but the pattern in the same) would be: Question and Answer Chain (Retriever connector) -> Vector Store Retriever (Vector Store connector) -> Zep Vector Store.\n\n### Use the Vector Store Question Answer Tool to answer questions[#](#use-the-vector-store-question-answer-tool-to-answer-questions \"Permanent link\")\n\nAnother pattern uses the [Vector Store Question Answer Tool](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolvectorstore/) to summarize results and answer questions from the Zep Vector Store node. Rather than connecting the Zep Vector Store directly as a tool, this pattern uses a tool specifically designed to summarizes data in the vector store.\n\nThe [connections flow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2621-ai-agent-to-chat-with-files-in-supabase-storage/) (this example uses Supabase, but the pattern is the same) in this case would look like this: AI agent (tools connector) -> Vector Store Question Answer Tool (Vector Store connector) -> Zep Vector store.\n\n## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\n### Operation Mode[#](#operation-mode \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis Vector Store node has four modes: **Get Many**, **Insert Documents**, **Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)**, and **Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)**. The mode you select determines the operations you can perform with the node and what inputs and outputs are available.\n\n#### Get Many[#](#get-many \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn this mode, you can retrieve multiple documents from your vector database by providing a prompt. The prompt will be embedded and used for similarity search. The node will return the documents that are most similar to the prompt with their similarity score. This is useful if you want to retrieve a list of similar documents and pass them to an agent as additional context.\n\n#### Insert Documents[#](#insert-documents \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse Insert Documents mode to insert new documents into your vector database.\n\n#### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool)[#](#retrieve-documents-as-vector-store-for-chaintool \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) mode with a vector-store retriever to retrieve documents from a vector database and provide them to the retriever connected to a chain. In this mode you must connect the node to a retriever node or root node.\n\n#### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent)[#](#retrieve-documents-as-tool-for-ai-agent \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) mode to use the vector store as a tool resource when answering queries. When formulating responses, the agent uses the vector store when the vector store name and description match the question details.\n\n### Insert Documents parameters[#](#insert-documents-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **Collection Name**: Enter the collection name to store the data in.\n\n### Get Many parameters[#](#get-many-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **Collection Name**: Enter the collection name to retrieve the data from.\n*   **Prompt**: Enter the search query.\n*   **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.\n\n### Retrieve Documents (As Vector Store for Chain/Tool) parameters[#](#retrieve-documents-as-vector-store-for-chaintool-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **Collection Name**: Enter the collection name to retrieve the data from.\n\n### Retrieve Documents (As Tool for AI Agent) parameters[#](#retrieve-documents-as-tool-for-ai-agent-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **Name**: The name of the vector store.\n*   **Description**: Explain to the LLM what this tool does. A good, specific description allows LLMs to produce expected results more often.\n*   **Collection Name**: Enter the collection name to retrieve the data from.\n*   **Limit**: Enter how many results to retrieve from the vector store. For example, set this to `10` to get the ten best results.\n\n## Node options[#](#node-options \"Permanent link\")\n\n### Embedding Dimensions[#](#embedding-dimensions \"Permanent link\")\n\nMust be the same when embedding the data and when querying it.\n\nThis sets the size of the array of floats used to represent the semantic meaning of a text document.\n\nRead more about Zep embeddings in [Zep's embeddings documentation](https://docs.getzep.com/deployment/embeddings/).\n\n### Is Auto Embedded[#](#is-auto-embedded \"Permanent link\")\n\nAvailable in the **Insert Documents** Operation Mode, enabled by default.\n\nDisable this to configure your embeddings in Zep instead of in n8n.\n\n### Metadata Filter[#](#metadata-filter \"Permanent link\")\n\nAvailable in **Get Many** mode. When searching for data, use this to match with metadata associated with the document.\n\nThis is an `AND` query. If you specify more than one metadata filter field, all of them must match.\n\nWhen inserting data, the metadata is set using the document loader. Refer to [Default Data Loader](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.documentdefaultdataloader/) for more information on loading documents.\n\n## Templates and examples[#](#templates-and-examples \"Permanent link\")\n\nRefer to [LangChain's Zep documentation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/zep/) for more information about the service.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/) documentation.\n\n## AI glossary[#](#ai-glossary \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **completion**: Completions are the responses generated by a model like GPT.\n*   **hallucinations**: Hallucination in AI is when an LLM (large language model) mistakenly perceives patterns or objects that don't exist.\n*   **vector database**: A vector database stores mathematical representations of information.

When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and have an expression in your **Text** that isn't generating a value.\n    *   To resolve, make sure your expressions reference valid fields and that they resolve to valid input rather than null.\n2.  When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has null values.\n    *   To resolve, remove any null values from the `chatInput` field of the input node.\n\n## Error in sub-node Window Buffer Memory[#](#error-in-sub-node-window-buffer-memory \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis error displays when n8n runs into an issue with the [Window Buffer Memory](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.memorybufferwindow/) sub-node.\n\nIt most often occurs when your workflow or the workflow template you copied uses an older version of the Window Buffer Memory node.\n\nTry removing the Window Buffer Memory node from your workflow and re-adding it, which will guarantee you're using the latest version of the node.\n\n## A Chat Model sub-node must be connected error[#](#a-chat-model-sub-node-must-be-connected-error \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis error displays when n8n tries to execute the node without having a Chat Model connected.\n\nTo resolve this, click the + Chat Model button at the bottom of your screen when the node is open, or click the Chat Model + connector when the node is closed. n8n will then open a selection of possible Chat Models to pick from.\n\n## No prompt specified error[#](#no-prompt-specified-error \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis error occurs when the agent expects to get the prompt from the previous node automatically. Typically, this happens when you're using the [Chat Trigger Node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/).\n\nTo resolve this issue, find the **Prompt** parameter of the AI Agent node and change it from **Connected Chat Trigger Node** to **Define below**. This allows you to manually build your prompt by referencing output data from other nodes or by adding static text."

When you've set the **Prompt** to **Define below** and have an expression in your **Text** that isn't generating a value.\n    *   To resolve, enter a valid prompt in the **Text** field.\n    *   Make sure any expressions reference valid fields and that they resolve to valid input rather than null.\n2.  When you've set the **Prompt** to **Connected Chat Trigger Node** and the incoming data has null values.\n    *   To resolve, make sure your input contains a `chatInput` field. Add an [Edit Fields (Set)](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.set/) node to edit an incoming field name to `chatInput`.\n    *   Remove any null values from the `chatInput` field of the input node.\n\n## A Retriever sub-node must be connected error[#](#a-retriever-sub-node-must-be-connected-error \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis error displays when n8n tries to execute the node without having a Retriever connected.\n\nTo resolve this, click the + Retriever button at the bottom of your screen when the node is open, or click the Retriever + connector when the node isn't open. n8n will then open a selection of possible Retrievers to pick from.\n\n## Can't produce longer responses[#](#cant-produce-longer-responses \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you need to generate longer responses than the Question and Answer Chain node produces by default, you can try one or more of the following techniques:\n\n*   **Connect a more verbose model**: Some AI models produce more terse results than others. Swapping your model for one with a larger context window and more verbose output can increase the word length of your responses.\n*   **Increase the maximum number of tokens**: Many model nodes (for example the [OpenAI Chat Model](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmchatopenai/#maximum-number-of-tokens)) include a **Maximum Number of Tokens** option. You can set this to increase the maximum number of tokens the model can use to produce a response.\n*   **Build larger responses in stages**: For more detailed answers, you may want to construct replies in stages using a variety of AI nodes. You can use AI split up a single question into multiple prompts and create responses for each. You can then compose a final reply by combining the responses again. Though the details are different, you can find a good example of the general idea in this [template for writing a WordPress post with AI](https://n8n.io/workflows/2187-write-a-wordpress-post-with-ai-starting-from-a-few-keywords/)."

You can use expressions here for dynamic content.\n\n### Require Specific Output Format[#](#require-specific-output-format \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis parameter controls whether you want the node to require a specific output format.

The model will try to respond in the same way in its messages.\n\n#### System[#](#system \"Permanent link\")\n\nEnter a system **Message** to include with the user input to help guide the model in what it should do.\n\nUse this option for things like defining tone, for example: `Always respond talking like a pirate`.\n\n#### User[#](#user \"Permanent link\")\n\nEnter a sample user input. Using this with the AI option can help improve the output of the agent. Using both together provides a sample of an input and expected response (the **AI Message**) for the model to follow.\n\nSelect one of these input types:\n\n*   **Text**: Enter a sample user input as a text **Message**.\n*   **Image (Binary)**: Select a binary input from a previous node. Enter the **Image Data Field Name** to identify which binary field from the previous node contains the image data.\n*   **Image (URL)**: Use this option to feed an image in from a URL. Enter the **Image URL**.\n\nFor both the **Image** types, select the **Image Details** to control how the model processes the image and generates its textual understanding. Choose from:\n\n*   **Auto**: The model uses the auto setting, which looks at the image input size and decide if it should use the Low or High setting.\n*   **Low**: The model receives a low-resolution 512px x 512px version of the image and represents the image with a budget of 65 tokens. This allows the API to return faster responses and consume fewer input tokens. Use this option for use cases that don't require high detail.\n*   **High**: The model can access the low-resolution image and then creates detailed crops of input images as 512px squares based on the input image size. Each of the detailed crops uses twice the token budget (65 tokens) for a total of 129 tokens.

You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\n### Name[#](#name \"Permanent link\")\n\nEnter a name for your custom code. It can't contain whitespace or special characters.\n\n### Description[#](#description \"Permanent link\")\n\nEnter a custom code a description. This tells the agent when to use this tool. For example:\n\n> Call this tool to get a random color. The input should be a string with comma separated names of colors to exclude.\n\n### Source[#](#source \"Permanent link\")\n\nTell n8n which workflow to call.

You can access these values in expressions in the workflow. For example, if you have:\n\n*   **Workflow Values** with a **Name** of `myCustomValue`\n*   A workflow with an Execute Workflow Trigger node as its trigger\n\nThe expression to access the value of `myCustomValue` is `{{ $('Execute Workflow Trigger').item.json.myCustomValue }}`.\n\n### Specify input schema[#](#specify-input-schema \"Permanent link\")\n\nAgent support\n\nThe structured input schema requires with a Tools Agent or OpenAI Functions Agent.\n\nEnable this option to define the input schema for the workflow you're calling. This is useful when you want to make sure the input data the LLM provides is in the correct format.\n\n**Schema Type**: Define the input structure and validation. You have two options to provide the schema:\n\n1.  **Generate from JSON Example**: Input an example JSON object to automatically generate the schema. The node uses the object property types and names. It ignores the actual values.\n2.  **Define Below**: Manually input the JSON schema. Read the JSON Schema [guides and examples](https://json-schema.org/learn/miscellaneous-examples) for help creating a valid JSON schema.\n\n## Templates and examples[#](#templates-and-examples \"Permanent link\")\n\n[Browse Custom n8n Workflow Tool integration templates](https://n8n.io/integrations/workflow-tool/), or [search all templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/)\n\nRefer to [LangChain's documentation on tools](https://js.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/tools/) for more information about tools in LangChain.\n\nView n8n's [Advanced AI](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/) documentation.\n\n## AI glossary[#](#ai-glossary \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   **completion**: Completions are the responses generated by a model like GPT.\n*   **hallucinations**: Hallucination in AI is when an LLM (large language model) mistakenly perceives patterns or objects that don't exist.\n*   **vector database**: A vector database stores mathematical representations of information.

Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.\n\nMost nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n## Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance[#](#cant-connect-to-a-remote-ollama-instance \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Ollama Chat Model node is only designed to connect to a locally hosted Ollama instance. It doesn't include the authentication features you'd need to connect to a remotely hosted Ollama instance.\n\nTo use the Ollama Chat Model, follow the [Ollama credentials instructions](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to set up Ollama locally and configure the instance URL in n8n.\n\n## Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker[#](#cant-connect-to-a-local-ollama-instance-when-using-docker \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Ollama Chat Model node connects to a locally hosted Ollama instance using the base URL defined by [Ollama credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/). When you run either n8n or Ollama in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Ollama.\n\nOllama typically listens for connections on `localhost`, the local network address. In Docker, by default, each container has its own `localhost` which is only accessible from within the container. If either n8n or Ollama are running in containers, they won't be able to connect over `localhost`.\n\nThe solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.\n\n### If only Ollama is in Docker[#](#if-only-ollama-is-in-docker \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf only Ollama is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).\n\nWhen running the container, [publish the ports](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, Ollama runs on port 11434, so your Docker command should look like this:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama` |\n\nWhen configuring [Ollama credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **base URL** to `http://localhost:11434`).\n\n### If only n8n is in Docker[#](#if-only-n8n-is-in-docker \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf only n8n is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.\n\nIf you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux**, use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n` |\n\nIf you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.\n\nWhen configuring [Ollama credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/), use `host.docker.internal` as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, to bind to the default port 11434, you could set the base URL to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`.\n\n### If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers[#](#if-ollama-and-n8n-are-running-in-separate-docker-containers \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf both n8n and Ollama are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.\n\nConfigure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).\n\nWhen configuring [Ollama credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/), use the Ollama container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the Ollama container `my-ollama` and it listens on the default port 11434, you would set the base URL to `http://my-ollama:11434`.\n\n### If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container[#](#if-ollama-and-n8n-are-running-in-the-same-docker-container \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure Ollama to listen on localhost and configure the base URL in the [Ollama credentials in n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to use localhost: `http://localhost:11434`.\n\n## Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434[#](#error-connect-econnrefused-111434 \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis error occurs when your computer has IPv6 enabled, but Ollama is listening to an IPv4 address.\n\nTo fix this, change the base URL in your [Ollama credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to connect to `127.0.0.1`, the IPv4-specific local address, instead of the `localhost` alias that can resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`."

For example, given an input of five `name` values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item.

Sub-nodes behave differently than other nodes when processing multiple items using expressions.\n\nMost nodes, including root nodes, take any number of items as input, process these items, and output the results. You can use expressions to refer to input items, and the node resolves the expression for each item in turn. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` resolves to each name in turn.\n\nIn sub-nodes, the expression always resolves to the first item. For example, given an input of five name values, the expression `{{ $json.name }}` always resolves to the first name.\n\n## Can't connect to a remote Ollama instance[#](#cant-connect-to-a-remote-ollama-instance \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Ollama Model node is only designed to connect to a locally hosted Ollama instance. It doesn't include the authentication features you'd need to connect to a remotely hosted Ollama instance.\n\nTo use the Ollama Model, follow the [Ollama credentials instructions](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to set up Ollama locally and configure the instance URL in n8n.\n\n## Can't connect to a local Ollama instance when using Docker[#](#cant-connect-to-a-local-ollama-instance-when-using-docker \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Ollama Model node connects to a locally hosted Ollama instance using the base URL defined by [Ollama credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/). When you run either n8n or Ollama in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Ollama.\n\nOllama typically listens for connections on `localhost`, the local network address. In Docker, by default, each container has its own `localhost` which is only accessible from within the container. If either n8n or Ollama are running in containers, they won't be able to connect over `localhost`.\n\nThe solution depends on how you're hosting the two components.\n\n### If only Ollama is in Docker[#](#if-only-ollama-is-in-docker \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf only Ollama is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).\n\nWhen running the container, [publish the ports](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/publishing-ports/) with the `-p` flag. By default, Ollama runs on port 11434, so your Docker command should look like this:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama` |\n\nWhen configuring [Ollama credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/), the `localhost` address should work without a problem (set the **base URL** to `http://localhost:11434`).\n\n### If only n8n is in Docker[#](#if-only-n8n-is-in-docker \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf only n8n is running in Docker, configure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` on the host.\n\nIf you are running n8n in Docker on **Linux**, use the `--add-host` flag to map `host.docker.internal` to `host-gateway` when you start the container. For example:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n` |\n\nIf you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you.\n\nWhen configuring [Ollama credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/), use `host.docker.internal` as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, to bind to the default port 11434, you could set the base URL to `http://host.docker.internal:11434`.\n\n### If Ollama and n8n are running in separate Docker containers[#](#if-ollama-and-n8n-are-running-in-separate-docker-containers \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf both n8n and Ollama are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them.\n\nConfigure Ollama to listen on all interfaces by binding to `0.0.0.0` inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way).\n\nWhen configuring [Ollama credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/), use the Ollama container's name as the host address instead of `localhost`. For example, if you call the Ollama container `my-ollama` and it listens on the default port 11434, you would set the base URL to `http://my-ollama:11434`.\n\n### If Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container[#](#if-ollama-and-n8n-are-running-in-the-same-docker-container \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf Ollama and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the `localhost` address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure Ollama to listen on localhost and configure the base URL in the [Ollama credentials in n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to use localhost: `http://localhost:11434`.\n\n## Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434[#](#error-connect-econnrefused-111434 \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis error occurs when your computer has IPv6 enabled, but Ollama is listening to an IPv4 address.\n\nTo fix this, change the base URL in your [Ollama credentials](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/ollama/) to connect to `127.0.0.1`, the IPv4-specific local address, instead of the `localhost` alias that can resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6: `http://127.0.0.1:11434`."

Refer to [Choose an authentication method](#choose-an-authentication-method) for more guidance.\n\nRefer to [Discord's Developer documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) for more information about the service.\n\n## Using bot[#](#using-bot \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse this method if you want to add the bot to your Discord server using a bot token rather than OAuth2.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n*   A **Bot Token**: Generated once you create an application with a bot.\n\nTo create an application with a bot and generate the **Bot Token**:\n\n1.  If you don't have one already, create an app in the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications?new_application=true).\n2.  Enter a **Name** for your app.\n3.  Select **Create**.\n4.  Select **Bot** from the left menu.\n5.  Under **Token**, select **Reset Token** to generate a new bot token.\n6.  Copy the token and add it to your n8n credential.\n7.  In **Bot > Privileged Gateway Intents**, add any privileged intents you want your bot to have. Refer to [Configuring your bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#configuring-your-bot) for more information on privileged intents.\n    *   n8n recommends activating **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT: Required for your bot to receive events listed under GUILD\\_MEMBERS**.\n8.  In **Installation > Installation Contexts**, select the installation contexts you want your bot to use:\n    *   Select **Guild Install** for server-installed apps. (Most common for n8n users.)\n    *   Select **User Install** for user-installed apps. (Less common for n8n users, but may be useful for testing.)\n    *   Refer to Discord's [Choosing installation contexts](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#choosing-installation-contexts) documentation for more information about these installation contexts.\n9.  In **Installation > Install Link**, select **Discord Provided Link** if it's not already selected.\n10.  Still on the **Installation** page, in the **Default Install Settings** section, select `applications.commands` and `bot` scopes. Refer to Discord's [Scopes](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes) documentation for more information about these and other scopes.\n11.  Add permissions on the **Bot > Bot Permissions** page. Refer to Discord's [Permissions](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions) documentation for more information. n8n recommends selecting these permissions for the [Discord](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.discord/) node:\n    *   Manage Roles\n    *   Manage Channels\n    *   Read Messages/View Channels\n    *   Send Messages\n    *   Create Public Threads\n    *   Create Private Threads\n    *   Send Messages in Threads\n    *   Send TTS Messages\n    *   Manage Messages\n    *   Manage Threads\n    *   Embed Links\n    *   Attach Files\n    *   Read Message History\n    *   Add Reactions\n12.  Add the app to your server or test server:\n    1.  Go to **Installation > Install Link** and copy the link listed there.\n    2.  Paste the link in your browser and hit Enter.\n    3.  Select **Add to server** in the installation prompt.\n    4.  Once your app's added to your server, you'll see it in the member list.\n\nThese steps outline the basic functionality needed to set up your n8n credential. Refer to the [Discord Creating an App](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-1-creating-an-app) guide for more information on creating an app, especially:\n\n*   [Fetching your credentials](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#fetching-your-credentials) for getting your app's credentials into your local developer environment.\n*   [Handling interactivity](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-3-handling-interactivity) for information on setting up public endpoints for interactive `/slash` commands.\n\n## Using OAuth2[#](#using-oauth2 \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse this method if you want to add the bot to Discord servers using the OAuth2 flow, which simplifies the process for those installing your app.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n*   A **Client ID**\n*   A **Client Secret**\n*   Choose whether to send **Authentication** in the **Header** or **Body**\n*   A **Bot Token**\n\nFor details on creating an application with a bot and generating the token, follow the same steps as in [Using bot](#using-bot) above.\n\nThen:\n\n1.  Copy the **Bot Token** you generate and add it into the n8n credential.\n2.  Open the **OAuth2** page in your Discord application to access your **Client ID** and generate a **Client Secret**. Add these to your n8n credential.\n3.  From n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and add it into the Discord application in **OAuth2 > Redirects**. Be sure you save these changes.\n\n## Using webhook[#](#using-webhook \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n*   A **Webhook URL**: Generated once you create a webhook.\n\nTo get a Webhook URL, you create a webhook and copy the URL that gets generated:\n\n1.  Open your Discord **Server Settings** and open the **Integrations** tab.\n2.  Select **Create Webhook** to create a new webhook.\n3.  Give your webhook a **Name** that makes sense.\n4.  Select the **avatar** next to the **Name** to edit or upload a new avatar.\n5.  In the **CHANNEL** dropdown, select the channel the webhook should post to.\n6.  Select **Copy Webhook URL** to copy the Webhook URL. Enter this URL in your n8n credential.\n\nRefer to the [Discord Making a Webhook documentation](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) for more information.\n\n## Choose an authentication method[#](#choose-an-authentication-method \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe simplest installation is a **webhook**. You create and add webhooks to a single channel on a Discord server. Webhooks can post messages to a channel. They don't require a bot user or authentication. But they can't listen or respond to user requests or commands. If you need a straightforward way to send messages to a channel without the need for interaction or feedback, use a webhook.\n\nA **bot** is an interactive step up from a webhook. You add bots to the Discord server (referred to as a `guild` in the Discord API documentation) or to user accounts. Bots added to the server can interact with users on all the server's channels. They can manage channels, send and retrieve messages, retrieve the list of all users, and change their roles. If you need to build an interactive, complex, or multi-step workflow, use a bot.\n\n**OAuth2** is basically a **bot** that uses an OAuth2 flow rather than just the bot token. As with bots, you add these to the Discord server or to user accounts. These credentials offer the same functionalities as bots, but they can simplify the installation of the bot on your server."

In **Name your app**, enter a name for your app, like `n8n integration`.\n6.  Check the box to agree to the **Dropbox API Terms and Conditions**.\n7.  Select **Create app**. The app's **Settings** open.\n8.  Copy the **App key** and enter it as the **Client ID** in your n8n credential.\n9.  Copy the **Secret** and enter it as the **Client Secret** in your n8n credential.\n10.  In n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and enter it in the Dropbox **Redirect URIs**.\n11.  In n8n, select the same **App Access Type** you selected for your app.\n\nRefer to the instructions in the [Dropbox Implementing OAuth documentation](https://developers.dropbox.com/oauth-guide#implementing-oauth) for more information.\n\nFor internal tools and limited usage, you can keep your app private. But if you'd like your app to be used by more than 50 users or you want to distribute it, you'll need to complete Dropbox's production approval process. Refer to **Production Approval** in the [DBX Platform developer guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide) for more information.\n\nUser limits\n\nOn the **Settings** tab, you can add other users to your app. Once your app links 50 Dropbox users, you will have two weeks to apply for and receive production status approval before Dropbox freezes your app from linking more users."

[Create a Meta app](#create-a-meta-app) with the Webhooks product.\n2.  [Generate an App Access Token](#generate-an-app-access-token) for that app.\n3.  [Configure the Facebook trigger](#configure-the-facebook-trigger).\n4.  Optional: [Add an app secret](#optional-add-an-app-secret).\n5.  [App Review](#app-review): Only required if your app's users don't have roles on the app itself. If you're creating the app for your own internal purposes, this isn't necessary.\n\nRefer to the detailed instructions below for each step.\n\n### Create a Meta app[#](#create-a-meta-app \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo create a Meta app:\n\n1.  Go to the Meta Developer [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and select **Create App**.\n2.  If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select **I don’t want to connect a business portfolio yet** and select **Next**. The **Use cases** page opens.\n3.  Select **Other**, then select **Next**.\n4.  Select **Business** and **Next**.\n5.  Complete the essential information:\n    *   Add an **App name**.\n    *   Add an **App contact email**.\n    *   Here again you can connect to a business portfolio or skip it.\n6.  Select **Create app**.\n7.  The **Add products to your app** page opens.\n8.  Select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.\n9.  Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app \"Live.\")\n10.  Select **Save changes**.\n11.  At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.\n12.  In the left menu, select **Add Product**.\n13.  The **Add products to your app** page appears. Select **Webhooks**.\n14.  The **Webhooks** product opens.\n\nRefer to Meta's [Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products.\n\nFor more information on the app modes and switching to **Live** mode, refer to [App Modes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes) and [Publish | App Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release#app-types).\n\n### Generate an App Access Token[#](#generate-an-app-access-token \"Permanent link\")\n\nNext, create an app access token to be used by your n8n credential and the Webhooks product:\n\n1.  In a separate tab or window, open the [Graph API explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/).\n2.  Select the **Meta App** you just created in the **Access Token** section.\n3.  In **User or Page**, select **Get App Token**.\n4.  Select **Generate Access Token**.\n5.  The page prompts you to log in and grant access. Follow the on-screen prompts.\n    \n    App unavailable\n    \n    You may receive a warning that the app isn't available. Once you take an app live, there may be a few minutes' delay before you can generate an access token.\n    \n6.  Copy the token and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Access Token**. Save this token somewhere else, too, since you'll need it for the Webhooks configuration.\n    \n7.  Save your n8n credential.\n\nRefer to the Meta instructions for [Your First Request](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/get-started#get-started) for more information on generating the token.\n\n### Configure the Facebook Trigger[#](#configure-the-facebook-trigger \"Permanent link\")\n\nNow that you have a token, you can configure the Facebook Trigger node:\n\n1.  In your Meta app, copy the **App ID** from the top navigation bar.\n2.  In n8n, open your Facebook Trigger node.\n3.  Paste the **App ID** into the **APP ID** field.\n4.  Select **Test step** to shift the trigger into listening mode.\n5.  Return to the tab or window where your Meta app's **Webhooks** product configuration is open.\n6.  **Subscribe** to the objects you want to receive Facebook Trigger notifications about. For each subscription:\n    1.  Copy the **Webhook URL** from n8n and enter it as the **Callback URL** in your Meta App.\n    2.  Enter the **Access Token** you copied above as the **Verify token**.\n    3.  Select **Verify and save**. (This step fails if you don't have your n8n trigger listening.)\n    4.  Some webhook subscriptions, like **User**, prompt you to subscribe to individual events. Subscribe to the events you're interested in.\n    5.  You can send some **Test** events from Meta to confirm things are working. If you send a test event, verify its receipt in n8n.\n\nRefer to the [Facebook Trigger node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.facebooktrigger/) documentation for more information.\n\n### Optional: Add an App Secret[#](#optional-add-an-app-secret \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor added security, Meta recommends adding an **App Secret**. This signs all API calls with the `appsecret_proof` parameter. The app secret proof is a sha256 hash of your access token, using your app secret as the key.\n\nTo generate an App Secret:\n\n1.  In Meta while viewing your app, select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.\n2.  Select **Show** next to the **App secret** field.\n3.  The page prompts you to re-enter your Facebook account credentials. Once you do so, Meta shows the App Secret.\n4.  Highlight it to select it, copy it, and paste this into your n8n credential as the **App Secret**.\n5.  **Save** your n8n credential.\n\nRefer to the [App Secret documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/security#appsecret) for more information.\n\n### App review[#](#app-review \"Permanent link\")\n\nApp Review requires Business Verification.\n\nYour app must go through App Review if it will be used by someone who:\n\n*   Doesn't have a role on the app itself.\n*   Doesn't have a role in the Business that has claimed the app.\n\nIf your only app users are users who have a role on the app itself, App Review isn't required.\n\nAs part of the App Review process, you may need to request advanced access for your webhook subscriptions.\n\nRefer to Meta's [App Review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/resp-plat-initiatives/app-review) and [Advanced Access](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/overview/access-levels#advanced-access) documentation for more information.\n\n## Common issues[#](#common-issues \"Permanent link\")\n\n### Unverified apps limit[#](#unverified-apps-limit \"Permanent link\")\n\nFacebook only lets you have a developer or administrator role on a maximum of 15 apps that aren't already linked to a Meta Verified Business Account.\n\nRefer to [Limitations | Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app#limitations) if you're over that limit."

[Create a Meta app](#create-a-meta-app) with the products you need to access.\n2.  [Generate an App Access Token](#generate-an-app-access-token) for that app.\n\nRefer to the detailed instructions below for each step.\n\n### Create a Meta app[#](#create-a-meta-app \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo create a Meta app:\n\n1.  Go to the Meta Developer [App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and select **Create App**.\n2.  If you have a business portfolio and you're ready to connect the app to it, select the business portfolio. If you don't have a business portfolio or you're not ready to connect the app to the portfolio, select **I don’t want to connect a business portfolio yet** and select **Next**. The **Use cases** page opens.\n3.  Select the **Use case** that aligns with how you wish to use the Facebook Graph API. For example, for products in Meta's **Business** suite (like Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Marketing API, App Events, Audience Network, Commerce API, Fundraisers, Jobs, Threat Exchange, and Webhooks), select **Other**, then select **Next**.\n4.  Select **Business** and **Next**.\n5.  Complete the essential information:\n    *   Add an **App name**.\n    *   Add an **App contact email**.\n    *   Here again you can connect to a business portfolio or skip it.\n6.  Select **Create app**.\n7.  The **Add products to your app** page opens.\n8.  Select **App settings > Basic** from the left menu.\n9.  Enter a **Privacy Policy URL**. (Required to take the app \"Live.\")\n10.  Select **Save changes**.\n11.  At the top of the page, toggle the **App Mode** from **Development** to **Live**.\n12.  In the left menu, select **Add Product**.\n13.  The **Add products to your app** page appears. Select the products that make sense for your app and configure them.\n\nRefer to Meta's [Create an app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app) documentation for more information on creating an app, required fields like the Privacy Policy URL, and adding products.\n\nFor more information on the app modes and switching to **Live** mode, refer to [App Modes](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes) and [Publish | App Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/release#app-types).\n\n### Generate an App Access Token[#](#generate-an-app-access-token \"Permanent link\")\n\nNext, create an app access token to use with your n8n credential and the products you selected:\n\n1.  In a separate tab or window, open the [Graph API explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/).\n2.  Select the **Meta App** you just created in the **Access Token** section.\n3.  In **User or Page**, select **Get App Token**.\n4.  Select **Generate Access Token**.\n5.  The page prompts you to log in and grant access. Follow the on-screen prompts.\n    \n    App unavailable\n    \n    You may receive a warning that the app isn't available. Once you take an app live, there may be a few minutes' delay before you can generate an access token.\n    \n6.  Copy the token and enter it in your n8n credential as the **Access Token**.\n    \n\nRefer to the Meta instructions for [Your First Request](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/get-started#get-started) for more information on generating the token."

It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.\n\nYou can use [Predefined credential types](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/custom-operations/#predefined-credential-types) to perform custom operations with some APIs where n8n has a node for the platform. For example, n8n has an Asana node, and supports using your Asana credentials in the HTTP Request node. Refer to [Custom operations](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/custom-operations/) for more information.\n\n## Using predefined credential type[#](#using-predefined-credential-type \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo use a predefined credential type:\n\n1.  Open your HTTP Request node, or add a new one to your workflow.\n2.  In **Authentication**, select **Predefined Credential Type**.\n3.  In **Credential Type**, select the API you want to use.\n4.  In **Credential for `<API name>`**, you can:\n    1.  Select an existing credential for that platform, if available.\n    2.  Select **Create New** to create a new credential.\n\nRefer to [Custom API operations](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/custom-operations/) for more information.\n\n## Using basic auth[#](#using-basic-auth \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports basic authentication.\n\nTo configure this credential, enter:\n\n*   The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting\n*   The **Password** that goes with that username\n\n## Using digest auth[#](#using-digest-auth \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports digest authentication.\n\nTo configure this credential, enter:\n\n*   The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting\n*   The **Password** that goes with that username\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports header authentication.\n\nTo configure this credential, enter:\n\n*   The header **Name** you need to pass to the app or service your HTTP request is targeting\n*   The **Value** for the header\n\nRead more about [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers#authentication).\n\nCredential data can vary\n\nThe credential data required for header auth credentials depends on the type used. For example, if you need to provide an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, the credential data `Name` will be `Authorization` and the `Value` will be `Bearer <token>`.\n\n## Using OAuth1[#](#using-oauth1 \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth1 authentication.\n\nTo configure this credential, enter:\n\n*   An **Authorization URL**: Also known as the Resource Owner Authorization URI. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/authorize`. The temporary credentials are sent here to prompt a user to complete authorization.\n*   An **Access Token URL**: This is the URI used for the initial request for temporary credentials. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/request` or `/oauth1/token`.\n*   A **Consumer Key**: Also known as the client key, like a username. This specifies the `oauth_consumer_key` to use for the call.\n*   A **Consumer Secret**: Also known as the client secret, like a password.\n*   A **Request Token URL**: This is the URI used to switch from temporary credentials to long-lived credentials after authorization. This URL typically ends in `/oauth1/access`.\n*   Select the **Signature Method** the auth handshake uses. This specifies the `oauth_signature_method` to use for the call. Options include:\n    *   **HMAC-SHA1**\n    *   **HMAC-SHA256**\n    *   **HMAC-SHA512**\n\nFor most OAuth1 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration to generate the values for most of these fields. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.\n\nRead more about [OAuth1](https://oauth.net/1/) and the [OAuth1 authorization flow](https://oauth1.wp-api.org/docs/basics/Auth-Flow.html).\n\n## Using OAuth2[#](#using-oauth2 \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports OAuth2 authentication.\n\nRequirements to configure this credential depend on the **Grant Type** selected. Refer to [OAuth Grant Types](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/) for more information on each grant type.\n\nFor most OAuth2 integrations, you'll need to configure an app, service, or integration. Use the **OAuth Redirect URL** in n8n as the redirect URL or redirect URI for such a service.\n\nRead more about [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/).\n\nUse Authorization Code grant type to exchange an authorization code for an access token. The auth flow uses the redirect URL to return the user to the client. Then the application gets the authorization code from the URL and uses it to request an access token. Refer to [Authorization Code Request](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/) for more information.\n\nTo configure this credential, select **Authorization Code** as the **Grant Type**.\n\nThen enter:\n\n*   An **Authorization URL**\n*   An **Access Token URL**\n*   A **Client ID**: The ID or username to log in with.\n*   A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in with.\n*   _Optional:_ Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.\n*   _Optional:_ Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.\n*   An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:\n    *   **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.\n    *   **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.\n*   _Optional:_ Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.\n\n### Client Credentials grant type[#](#client-credentials-grant-type \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse the Client Credentials grant type when applications request an access token to access their own resources, not on behalf of a user. Refer to [Client Credentials](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/) for more information.\n\nTo configure this credential, select **Client Credentials** as the **Grant Type**.\n\nThen enter:\n\n*   An **Access Token URL**: The URL to hit to begin the OAuth2 flow. Typically this URL ends in `/token`.\n*   A **Client ID**: The ID or username to use to log in to the client.\n*   A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in to the client.\n*   _Optional:_ Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. Most services don't support scopes for Client Credentials grant types; only enter scopes here if yours does.\n*   An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:\n    *   **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.\n    *   **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.\n*   _Optional:_ Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.\n\n### PKCE grant type[#](#pkce-grant-type \"Permanent link\")\n\nProof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) grant type is an extension to the Authorization Code flow to prevent CSRF and authorization code injection attacks.\n\nTo configure this credential, select **PKCE** as the **Grant Type**.\n\nThen enter:\n\n*   An **Authorization URL**\n*   An **Access Token URL**\n*   A **Client ID**: The ID or username to log in with.\n*   A **Client Secret**: The secret or password used to log in with.\n*   _Optional:_ Enter one or more **Scope**s for the credential. If unspecified, the credential will request all scopes available to the client.\n*   _Optional:_ Some services require more query parameters. If your service does, add them as **Auth URI Query Parameters**.\n*   An **Authentication** type: Select the option that best suits your use case. Options include:\n    *   **Header**: Send the credentials as a basic auth header.\n    *   **Body**: Send the credentials in the body of the request.\n*   _Optional:_ Choose whether to **Ignore SSL Issues**. If turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL validation fails.\n\n## Using query auth[#](#using-query-auth \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as a single key/value query parameter. (For multiple query parameters, use [Custom Auth](#using-custom-auth).)\n\nTo configure this credential, enter:\n\n*   A query parameter key or **Name**\n*   A query parameter **Value**\n\n## Using custom auth[#](#using-custom-auth \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse this generic authentication if your app or service supports passing authentication as multiple key/value query parameters or you need more flexibility than the other generic auth options.\n\nThe **Custom Auth** credential expects JSON data to define your credential. You can use `headers`, `qs`, `body` or a mix. Review the examples below to get started.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{ \t\"headers\": { \t\t\"X-AUTH-USERNAME\": \"username\", \t\t\"X-AUTH-PASSWORD\": \"password\" \t} }` |\n\n### Body[#](#body \"Permanent link\")\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{ \t \"body\" : { \t\t\"user\": \"username\", \t\t\"pass\": \"password\" \t} }` |\n\n### Query string[#](#query-string \"Permanent link\")\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{ \t\"qs\": {  \t\t\"appid\": \"123456\", \t\t\"apikey\": \"my-api-key\" \t} }` |\n\n### Sending header and query string[#](#sending-header-and-query-string \"Permanent link\")\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{ \t\"headers\": { \t\t\"api-version\": \"202404\" \t}, \t\"qs\": { \t\t\"apikey\": \"my-api-key\" \t} }` |\n\n## Provide an SSL certificate[#](#provide-an-ssl-certificate \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can send an SSL certificate with your HTTP request. Create the SSL certificate as a separate credential for use by the node:\n\n1.  In the HTTP Request node **Settings**, turn on **SSL Certificates**.\n2.  On the **Parameters** tab, add an existing SSL Certificate credential to **Credential for SSL Certificates** or create a new one.\n\nTo configure your SSL Certificates credential, you'll need to add:\n\n*   The Certificate Authority **CA** bundle\n*   The **Certificate** (CRT): May also appear as a Public Key, depending on who your issuing CA was and how they format the cert\n*   The **Private Key** (KEY)\n*   _Optional:_ If the **Private Key** is encrypted, enter a **Passphrase** for the private key.\n\nIf your SSL certificate is in a single file (such as a `.pfx` file), you'll need to open the file to copy details from it to paste into the appropriate fields:\n\n*   Enter the Public Key/CRT as the **Certificate**\n*   Enter the **Private Key**/KEY in that field"

[Generate a GitHub personal access token](#generate-personal-access-token).\n2.  [Set up the credential](#set-up-the-credential).\n\nRefer to the sections below for detailed instructions.\n\n### Generate personal access token[#](#generate-personal-access-token \"Permanent link\")\n\nRecommended access token type\n\nn8n recommends using a personal access token (classic). GitHub's fine-grained personal access tokens are still in beta and can't access all endpoints.\n\nTo generate your personal access token:\n\n1.  If you haven't done so already, verify your email address with GitHub. Refer to [Verifying your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/verifying-your-email-address) for more information.\n2.

In the left navigation, under **Personal access tokens**, select **Tokens (classic)**.\n5.  Select **Generate new token > Generate new token (classic)**.\n6.  Enter a descriptive name for your token in the **Note** field, like `n8n integration`.\n7.  Select the **Expiration** you'd like for the token, or select **No expiration**.\n8.  Select **Scopes** for your token. For most of the n8n GitHub nodes, add the `repo` scope.\n    *   A token without assigned scopes can only access public information.\n    *   Refer to\n9.  Select **Generate token**.\n10.  Copy the token.\n\nRefer to [Creating a personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) for more information. Refer to [Scopes for OAuth apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes) for more information on GitHub scopes.\n\n### Set up the credential[#](#set-up-the-credential \"Permanent link\")\n\nThen, in your n8n credential:\n\n1.  If you aren't using GitHub Enterprise Server, don't change the **GitHub server** URL.\n    *   If you're using [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-server), update **GitHub server** to match the URL for your server.\n2.  Enter your **User** name as it appears in your GitHub profile.\n3.  Enter the **Access Token** you generated above.\n\n## Using OAuth2[#](#using-oauth2 \"Permanent link\")\n\nNote for n8n Cloud users\n\nCloud users don't need to provide connection details. Select **Connect my account** to connect through your browser.\n\nIf you're [self-hosting n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/), create a new GitHub [OAuth app](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps):\n\n1.  Open your GitHub profile [Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile).\n2.  In the left navigation, select [**Developer settings**](https://github.com/settings/apps).\n3.  In the left navigation, select **OAuth apps**.\n4.  Select **New OAuth App**.\n    *   If you haven't created an app before, you may see **Register a new application** instead. Select it.\n5.  Enter an **Application name**, like `n8n integration`.\n6.  Enter the **Homepage URL** for your app's website.\n7.  If you'd like, add the optional **Application description**, which GitHub displays to end-users.\n8.  From n8n, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL** and paste it into the GitHub **Authorization callback URL**.\n9.  Select **Register application**.\n10.  Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** this generates and add them to your n8n credential.\n\nRefer to the [GitHub Authorizing OAuth apps documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/using-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps) for more information on the authorization process."

Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.\n    \n    ![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png)\n    \n    Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation\n    \n2.  Go to **APIs & Services > Library**.\n3.  Search for and select the API(s) you want to enable. For example, for the Gmail node, search for and enable the Gmail API.\n4.  Some integrations require other APIs or require you to request access:\n    \n    *   Google Perspective: [Request API Access](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-get-started).\n    *   Google Ads: Get a [Developer Token](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token).\n    \n    Google Drive API required\n    \n    The following integrations require the Google Drive API, as well as their own API:\n    \n    *   Google Docs\n    *   Google Sheets\n    *   Google Slides\n    \n5.  Select **ENABLE**.\n    \n\n### Configure your OAuth consent screen[#](#configure-your-oauth-consent-screen \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you haven't used OAuth in your Google Cloud project before, you'll need to [configure the OAuth consent screen](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent):\n\n1.  Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.\n    \n    ![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png)\n    \n    Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation\n    \n2.

For **User Type**, select **Internal** for user access within your organization's Google workspace or **External** for any user with a Google account. Refer to Google's [User type documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615#user-type&zippy=%2Cexternal%2Cinternal) for more information on user types.\n4.  Select **Create**.\n5.  Enter the essential information:\n    *   **App name**\n    *   **User support email**\n    *   **Email addresses** field in **Developer contact information**\n6.  In the **Authorized domains** section, add `n8n.cloud` if using n8n's Cloud service. If you're [self-hosting](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/), add the domain of your n8n instance.\n7.  Select **SAVE AND CONTINUE** to go to the **Scopes** page.\n8.  You don't need to set any scopes. Select **SAVE AND CONTINUE** again to go to the **Summary** page.\n9.  On the **Summary** page, review the information for accuracy.\n\n### Create your Google OAuth client credentials[#](#create-your-google-oauth-client-credentials \"Permanent link\")\n\nNext, create the OAuth client credentials in Google:\n\n1.  In the **APIs & Services** section, select **Credentials**.\n2.  Select **\\+ CREATE CREDENTIALS > OAuth client ID**.\n3.  In the **Application type** dropdown, select **Web application**.\n4.  Google automatically generates a **Name**. Update the **Name** to something you'll recognize in your console.\n5.  From your n8n credential, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**. Paste it into the **Authorized redirect URIs** in Google Console.\n6.  Select **CREATE**.\n\n### Finish your n8n credential[#](#finish-your-n8n-credential \"Permanent link\")\n\nWith the Google project and credentials fully configured, finish the n8n credential:\n\n1.  From Google's **OAuth client created** modal, copy the **Client ID**. Enter this in your n8n credential.\n2.  From the same Google modal, copy the **Client Secret**. Enter this in your n8n credential.\n3.  In n8n, select **Sign in with Google** to complete your Google authentication.\n4.  **Save** your new credentials.\n\n## Video[#](#video \"Permanent link\")\n\n## Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting \"Permanent link\")\n\n### Google hasn't verified this app[#](#google-hasnt-verified-this-app \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning **Google hasn't verified this app**. To avoid this, you can create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate.\n\nIf you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in [Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/reference/errors/authorization#google_hasnt_verified_this_app).\n\nFor Google Cloud apps with **Publishing status** set to **Testing** and **User type** set to **External**, consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to [Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615?hl=en#zippy=%2Ctesting) for more information.

[Create a Google Cloud Console project](#create-a-google-cloud-console-project).\n2.  [Enable APIs](#enable-apis).\n3.  [Configure your OAuth consent screen](#configure-your-oauth-consent-screen).\n4.  [Create your Google OAuth client credentials](#create-your-google-oauth-client-credentials).\n5.  [Finish your n8n credential](#finish-your-n8n-credential).\n\n### Create a Google Cloud Console project[#](#create-a-google-cloud-console-project \"Permanent link\")\n\nFirst, create a Google Cloud Console project. If you already have a project, jump to the next section:\n\n1.  Log in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) using your Google credentials.\n2.  In the top menu, select the project dropdown in the top navigation and select **New project** or go directly to the [New Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) page.\n3.

Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.\n    \n    [![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png)\n    \n    Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation\n    \n2.  Go to **APIs & Services > Library**.\n3.  Search for and select the API(s) you want to enable. For example, for the Gmail node, search for and enable the Gmail API.\n4.  Some integrations require other APIs or require you to request access:\n    \n    *   Google Perspective: [Request API Access](https://developers.perspectiveapi.com/s/docs-get-started).\n    *   Google Ads: Get a [Developer Token](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token).\n    \n    Google Drive API required\n    \n    The following integrations require the Google Drive API, as well as their own API:\n    \n    *   Google Docs\n    *   Google Sheets\n    *   Google Slides\n    \n5.  Select **ENABLE**.\n    \n\n### Configure your OAuth consent screen[#](#configure-your-oauth-consent-screen \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you haven't used OAuth in your Google Cloud project before, you'll need to [configure the OAuth consent screen](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent):\n\n1.  Access your [Google Cloud Console - Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library). Make sure you're in the correct project.\n    \n    [![The project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/credentials/google/google-cloud-project-dropdown.png)\n    \n    Check the project dropdown in the Google Cloud top navigation\n    \n2.  Open the left navigation menu and go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.\n3.  For **User Type**, select **Internal** for user access within your organization's Google workspace or **External** for any user with a Google account. Refer to Google's [User type documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615#user-type&zippy=%2Cexternal%2Cinternal) for more information on user types.\n4.  Select **Create**.\n5.  Enter the essential information:\n    *   **App name**\n    *   **User support email**\n    *   **Email addresses** field in **Developer contact information**\n6.  In the **Authorized domains** section, add `n8n.cloud` if using n8n's Cloud service. If you're [self-hosting](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/), add the domain of your n8n instance.\n7.  Select **SAVE AND CONTINUE** to go to the **Scopes** page.\n8.  You don't need to set any scopes. Select **SAVE AND CONTINUE** again to go to the **Summary** page.\n9.  On the **Summary** page, review the information for accuracy.\n\n### Create your Google OAuth client credentials[#](#create-your-google-oauth-client-credentials \"Permanent link\")\n\nNext, create the OAuth client credentials in Google:\n\n1.  In the **APIs & Services** section, select **Credentials**.\n2.  Select **\\+ CREATE CREDENTIALS > OAuth client ID**.\n3.  In the **Application type** dropdown, select **Web application**.\n4.  Google automatically generates a **Name**. Update the **Name** to something you'll recognize in your console.\n5.  From your n8n credential, copy the **OAuth Redirect URL**. Paste it into the **Authorized redirect URIs** in Google Console.\n6.  Select **CREATE**.\n\n### Finish your n8n credential[#](#finish-your-n8n-credential \"Permanent link\")\n\nWith the Google project and credentials fully configured, finish the n8n credential:\n\n1.  From Google's **OAuth client created** modal, copy the **Client ID**. Enter this in your n8n credential.\n2.  From the same Google modal, copy the **Client Secret**. Enter this in your n8n credential.\n3.  You must provide the scopes for this credential. Refer to [Scopes](#scopes) for more information. Enter multiple scopes in a space-separated list, for example:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.labels https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.current.action.compose` |\n    \n4.  In n8n, select **Sign in with Google** to complete your Google authentication.\n5.  **Save** your new credentials.\n\n## Video[#](#video \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe following video demonstrates the steps described above:\n\nGetting Google OAuth Credentials for n8n - YouTube\n\n## Scopes[#](#scopes \"Permanent link\")\n\nGoogle services have one or more possible access scopes. A scope limits what a user can do. Refer to [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) for a list of scopes for all services.\n\nn8n doesn't support all scopes. When creating a generic Google OAuth2 API credential, you can enter scopes from the **Supported scopes** list below. If you enter a scope that n8n doesn't already support, it won't work.\n\nSupported scopes\n\n## Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting \"Permanent link\")\n\n### Google hasn't verified this app[#](#google-hasnt-verified-this-app \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning **Google hasn't verified this app**. To avoid this, you can create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate.\n\nIf you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in [Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/reference/errors/authorization#google_hasnt_verified_this_app).\n\nFor Google Cloud apps with **Publishing status** set to **Testing** and **User type** set to **External**, consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to [Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/10311615?hl=en#zippy=%2Ctesting) for more information. To resolve this, reconnect the app in the n8n credentials modal."

Use the search bar to find and select your integration from the dropdown list.\n\nOnce you share at least one page with the integration, you can start making API requests. If the page isn't shared, any API requests made will respond with an error.\n\nRefer to [Integration permissions](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#integration-permissions) for more information.\n\n## Using OAuth2[#](#using-oauth2 \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n*   A **Client ID**: Generated once you configure a public integration.\n*   A **Client Secret**: Generated once you configure a public integration.\n\nYou must [create a Notion integration](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#create-your-integration-in-notion) and set it to public distribution:\n\n1.  Go to your Notion [integration dashboard](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).\n2.  Select the **\\+ New integration** button.\n3.  Enter a **Name** for your integration, for example `n8n integration`. If desired, add a **Logo**.\n4.  Select **Submit** to create your integration.\n5.  Open the **Capabilities** tab. Select these capabilities:\n    *   `Read content`\n    *   `Update content`\n    *   `Insert content`\n    *   `User information without email addresses`\n6.  Select **Save changes**.\n7.  Go to the **Distribution** tab.\n8.  Turn on the **Do you want to make this integration public?** control.\n9.  Enter your company name and website in the **Organization Information** section.\n10.  Copy the n8n **OAuth Redirect URL** and add it to as a **Redirect URI** in the Notion integration's **OAuth Domain & URLs** section.\n11.  Go to the **Secrets** tab.\n12.  Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and add them to your n8n credential.\n\nRefer to Notion's [public integration auth flow setup](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#public-integration-auth-flow-set-up) for more information about authenticating to the service.\n\n## Internal vs. public integrations[#](#internal-vs-public-integrations \"Permanent link\")\n\n**Internal** integrations are:\n\n*   Specific to a single workspace.\n*   Accessible only to members of that workspace.\n*   Ideal for custom workspace enhancements.\n\nInternal integrations use a simpler authentication process (the integration secret) and don't require any security review before publishing.\n\n**Public** integrations are:\n\n*   Usable across multiple, unrelated Notion workspaces.\n*   Accessible by any Notion user, regardless of their workspace.\n*   Ideal for catering to broad use cases.\n\nPublic integrations use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication. They require a Notion security review before publishing.\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of the two integration types, refer to Notion's [Internal vs. Public Integrations documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started#internal-vs-public-integrations)."

Follow these extra steps to complete the credential:\n\n1.  Enter your Dynamics **Domain**.\n2.  Select the Dynamics data center **Region** you're within.\n\nRefer to the [Microsoft Datacenter regions documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/new-datacenter-regions) for more information on the region options and corresponding URLs.\n\n#### Microsoft (general)[#](#microsoft-general \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe general Microsoft OAuth2 also requires you to provide a space-separated list of **Scope**s for this credential.\n\nRefer to [Scopes and permissions in the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scopes-oidc) for a list of possible scopes.\n\n#### Outlook[#](#outlook \"Permanent link\")\n\nOutlook OAuth2 supports the credential accessing a user's primary email inbox or a shared inbox. By default, the credential will access a user's primary email inbox. To change this behavior:\n\n1.  Turn on **Use Shared Inbox**.\n2.  Enter the target user's UPN or ID as the **User Principal Name**.\n\n#### SharePoint[#](#sharepoint \"Permanent link\")\n\nSharePoint OAuth2 requires information about your SharePoint **Subdomain**.\n\nTo complete the credential, enter the **Subdomain** part of your SharePoint URL. For example, if your SharePoint URL is `https://tenant123.sharepoint.com`, the subdomain is `tenant123`.\n\n## Common issues[#](#common-issues \"Permanent link\")\n\nHere are the known common errors and issues with Microsoft OAuth2 credentials.\n\n### Need admin approval[#](#need-admin-approval \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen attempting to add credentials for a Microsoft360 or Microsoft Entra account, users may see a message when following the procedure that this action requires admin approval.\n\nThis message will appear when the account attempting to grant permissions for the credential is managed by a Microsoft Entra. In order to issue the credential, the administrator account needs to grant permission to the user (or \"tenant\") for that application.\n\nThe procedure for this is covered in the [Microsoft Entra documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/grant-admin-consent)."

Enter the SQL Server Host Name as the **Server**. In an existing SQL Server connection, the host name comes before the instance name in the format `HOSTNAME\\INSTANCENAME`. Find the host name:\n    *   In the **Object Explorer** pane as the top-level object for your database.\n    *   In the footer of a query window.\n    *   Viewing the current connection **Properties** and looking for **Name** or **Display Name**.\n    *   Refer to [Find SQL Server Instance Name | When you're connected to SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#when-youre-connected-to-sql-server) for more information.

Find this name using the same steps listed above for finding the host name.\n    *   If you don't see an instance name in any of these places, then your database uses the default `MSSQLSERVER` instance name.\n3.  Enter your **User** account name or ID.\n4.  Enter your **Password**.\n5.  For the **Port**:\n    *   SQL Server defaults to `1433`.\n    *   If you can't connect over port 1433, check the [Error logs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/tutorials/ssms-tricks?view=sql-server-ver16#before-you-connect-to-sql-server) for the phrase `Server is listening on` to identify the port number you should enter.\n6.

Refer to the [SqlConnection.ConnectionTimeout property documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.connectiontimeout) for more information.\n    *   SQL Server stores this timeout as seconds, while n8n stores it as milliseconds. If you're copying your SQL Server defaults, multiple by 100 before entering the number here.\n10.  Enter the number of milliseconds n8n should wait on a given request before timing out as the **Request Timeout**. This is basically a query timeout parameter. Refer to [Troubleshoot query time-out errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/performance/troubleshoot-query-timeouts#explanation) for more information.\n11.  Select the Tabular Data Stream (TDS) protocol to use from the **TDS Version** dropdown. If the server doesn't support the version you select here, the connection uses a negotiated alternate version. Refer to [Appendix A: Product Behavior](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tds/135d0ebe-5c4c-4a94-99bf-1811eccb9f4a) for a more detailed breakdown of the TDS versions' compatibility with different SQL Server versions and .NET frameworks.

Most email providers offer instructions on setting up their service with SMTP. Refer to your provider's SMTP instructions.\n\n## Using SMTP account[#](#using-smtp-account \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n*   A **User** email address\n*   A **Password**: This may be the user's password or an app password. Refer to the documentation for your email provider.\n*   The **Host**: The SMTP host address for your email provider, often formatted as `smtp.<provider>.com`. Check with your provider.\n*   A **Port** number: The default is port `465`, commonly used for SSL. Other common ports are `587` for TLS or `25` for no encryption. Check with your provider.\n*   **SSL/TLS**: When turned on, SMTP will use SSL/TLS.\n*   **Disable STARTTLS**: When SSL/TLS is disabled, the SMTP server can still try to [upgrade the TCP connection using STARTTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS). Turning this on prevents that behaviour.\n*   **Client Host Name**: If needed by your provider, add a client host name. This name identifies the client to the server.\n\n### Provider instructions[#](#provider-instructions \"Permanent link\")\n\nRefer to the quickstart guides for these common email providers.\n\n#### Gmail[#](#gmail \"Permanent link\")\n\nRefer to [Gmail](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/sendemail/gmail).\n\n#### Outlook.com[#](#outlookcom \"Permanent link\")\n\nRefer to [Outlook.com](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/sendemail/outlook).\n\n#### Yahoo[#](#yahoo \"Permanent link\")\n\nRefer to [Yahoo](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/sendemail/yahoo).\n\n### My provider isn't listed[#](#my-provider-isnt-listed \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf your email provider isn't listed here, search for `SMTP settings` to find their instructions.

An SSH tunnel lets un-encrypted traffic pass over an encrypted connection and enables authorized remote access to servers protected from outside connections by a firewall.\n\nTo set up your database connection credential:\n\n1.  Enter your database's hostname as the **Host** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the hostname:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'hostname';` |\n    \n2.  Enter your database's name as the **Database** in your n8n credential. Run this query to confirm the database name:\n    \n3.  Enter the username of a **User** in the database. This user should have appropriate permissions for whatever actions you want n8n to perform.\n    \n4.  Enter the **Password** for that user.\n5.

Enter the **Connect Timeout** you'd like the node to use. The Connect Timeout is the number of milliseconds during the initial database connection the node should wait before timing out. n8n defaults to `1000` which is the default used by MySQL of 10 seconds. If you want to match your database's `connect_timeout`, run this query to get it, then multiply by 100 before entering it in n8n:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'connect_timeout';` |\n    \n7.

Enter the **SSH Host**. n8n uses this host to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.\n    3.  Enter the **SSH Port**. n8n uses this port to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.\n    4.  Enter the **SSH User** to connect with. n8n uses this user to create the SSH URI formatted as: `[user@]host:port`.\n    5.  If you selected **Password** for **SSH Authenticate with**, add the **SSH Password**.\n    6.  If you selected **Private Key** for **SSH Authenticate with**:\n        1.  Add the contents of the **Private Key** or identity file used for SSH. This is the same as using the `ssh-identity-file` option with the `shell-connect()` command in MySQL.\n        2.  If the **Private Key** was created with a passphrase, enter that **Passphrase**. This is the same as using the `ssh-identity-pass` option with the `shell-connect()` command in MySQL. If the **Private Key** has no passphrase, leave this field blank.\n\nRefer to [MySQL | Creating SSL and RSA Certificates and Keys](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-ssl-rsa-files.html) for more information on working with SSL certificates in MySQL.

Select **Save and release**.\n12.  Select **Overview** from the left menu. At this point, you can choose to **Test your app** by installing it to one of your stores, or **Choose distribution** to distribute it publicly.\n13.  In n8n, enter the **Shop Subdomain** of the store you installed the app to, either as a test or as a distribution.\n    *   Your subdomain is within the URL: `https://<subdomain>.myshopify.com`. For example, if the full URL is `https://n8n.myshopify.com`, the Shop Subdomain is `n8n`.\n\n## Using API key[#](#using-api-key \"Permanent link\")\n\nMethod deprecated\n\nShopify no longer generates API keys with passwords. Use the [Access token](#using-access-token) method instead.\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n*   An **API Key**\n*   A **Password**\n*   Your **Shop Subdomain**: Your subdomain is within the URL: `https://<subdomain>.myshopify.com`. For example, if the full URL is `https://n8n.myshopify.com`, the Shop Subdomain is `n8n`.\n*   _Optional:_ A **Shared Secret**\n\n## Common issues[#](#common-issues \"Permanent link\")\n\nHere are some common issues setting up the Shopify credential and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.\n\n### Enable custom app development[#](#enable-custom-app-development \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you don't see the option to **Create a custom app**, no one's enabled custom app development for your store.\n\nTo enable custom app development, you must log in either as a store owner or as a user with the **Enable app development** permission:\n\n1.  In Shopify, go to **Admin > Settings >** [**Apps and sales channels**](https://admin.shopify.com/settings/apps).\n2.  Select **Develop apps**.\n3.  Select **Allow custom app development**.\n4.  Read the warning and information provided and select **Allow custom app development**.\n\n### Forbidden credentials error[#](#forbidden-credentials-error \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you get a **Couldn't connect with these settings / Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials** warning when you test the credentials, this may be due to your app's [access scope](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes) dependencies. For example, the `read_orders` scope also requires `read_products` scope. Review the scopes you have assigned and the action you're trying to complete."

Refer to the more detailed instructions below.\n*   A user **Password**: Must be for a user account, not an admin account. Refer to the more detailed instructions below.\n*   The **URL**: Use the public URL of your Strapi server, defined in `./config/server.js` as the `url` parameter. Strapi recommends using an absolute URL.\n    *   For Strapi Cloud projects, use the URL of your Cloud project, for example: `https://my-strapi-project-name.strapiapp.com`\n*   The **API Version**: Select the version of the API you want your calls to use. Options include:\n    *   **Version 3**\n    *   **Version 4**\n\nIn Strapi, the configuration involves two steps:\n\n1.  [Configure a role](#configure-a-role).\n2.  [Create a user account](#create-a-user-account).\n\nRefer to the more detailed instructions below for each step.\n\n### Configure a role[#](#configure-a-role \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor API access, use the Users & Permissions Plugin in **Settings > Users & Permissions Plugin**.\n\nRefer to [Configuring Users & Permissions Plugin](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/settings/configuring-users-permissions-plugin-settings) for more information on the plugin. Refer to [Configuring end-user roles](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles) for more information on roles.\n\nFor the n8n credential, the user must have a role that grants them API permissions on the collection type. For the role, you can either:\n\n*   Update the default **Authenticated** role to include the permissions and assign the user to that role. Refer to [Configuring role's permissions](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles#configuring-roles-permissions) for more information.\n*   Create a new role to include the permissions and assign the user to that role. Refer to [Creating a new role](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles#creating-a-new-role) for more information.\n\nFor either option, once you open the role:\n\n1.  Go to the **Permissions** section.\n2.  Open the section for the relevant collection type.\n3.  Select the permissions for the collection type that the role should have. Options include:\n    *   `create` (POST)\n    *   `find` and `findone` (GET)\n    *   `update` (PUT)\n    *   `delete` (DELETE)\n4.  Repeat for all relevant collection types.\n5.  Save the role.\n\nRefer to [Endpoints](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest#endpoints) for more information on the permission options.\n\n### Create a user account[#](#create-a-user-account \"Permanent link\")\n\nNow that you have an appropriate role, create an end-user account and assign the role to it:\n\n1.  Go to **Content Manager > Collection Types > User**.\n2.  Select **Add new entry**.\n3.  Fill in the user details. The n8n credential requires these fields, though your Strapi project may have more custom required fields:\n    *   **Username**: Required for all Strapi users.\n    *   **Email**: Enter in Strapi and use as the **Email** in the n8n credential.\n    *   **Password**: Enter in Strapi and use as the **Password** in the n8n credential.\n    *   **Role**: Select the role you set up in the previous step.\n\nRefer to [Managing end-user accounts](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/managing-end-users) for more information.\n\n## Using API token[#](#using-api-token \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n*   An **API Token**: Create an API token from **Settings > Global Settings > API Tokens**. Refer to Strapi's [Creating a new API token documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/user-docs/settings/API-tokens#creating-a-new-api-token) for more details and information on regenerating API tokens.\n    \n    API tokens permission\n    \n    If you don't see the **API tokens** option in **Global settings**, your account doesn't have the **API tokens > Read** permission.\n    \n*   The **URL**: Use the public URL of your Strapi server, defined in `./config/server.js` as the `url` parameter. Strapi recommends using an absolute URL.\n    \n    *   For Strapi Cloud projects, use the URL of your Cloud project, for example: `https://my-strapi-project-name.strapiapp.com`\n*   The **API Version**: Select the version of the API you want your calls to use. Options include:\n    *   **Version 3**\n    *   **Version 4**"

Use the S3 node for generic or non-AWS S3 like:\n\n*   [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces)\n*   [MinIO](https://min.io/)\n*   [Wasabi](https://wasabi.com/)\n\n## Supported authentication methods[#](#supported-authentication-methods \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   S3 endpoint\n\nRefer to your S3-compatible provider's documentation for more information on the services. For example, refer to [Wasabi's REST API documentation](https://docs.wasabi.com/docs/rest-api-introduction) or [DigitalOcean's Spaces API Reference Documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/).\n\n## Using S3 endpoint[#](#using-s3-endpoint \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo configure this credential, you'll need:\n\n*   An **S3 Endpoint**: Enter the URL endpoint for the S3 storage backend.\n*   A **Region**: Enter the region for your S3 storage. Some providers call this the \"region slug.\"\n*   An **Access Key ID**: Enter the S3 access key your S3 provider uses to access the bucket or space. Some providers call this API keys.\n*   A **Secret Access Key**: Enter the secret access key for the **Access Key ID**.\n*   **Force Path Style**: When turned on, the connection uses path-style addressing for buckets.\n*   **Ignore SSL Issues**: When turned on, n8n will connect even if SSL certificate validation fails.\n\nMore detailed instructions for DigitalOcean Spaces and Wasabi follow. If you're using a different provider, refer to their documentation for more information.\n\n### Using DigitalOcean Spaces[#](#using-digitalocean-spaces \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo configure the credential for use with DigitalOcean spaces:\n\n1.  In DigitalOceans, go to the control panel and open **Settings**. Your endpoint should be listed there. Prepend `https://` to that endpoint and enter it as the **S3 Endpoint** in n8n.\n    *   Your DigitalOceans endpoint depends on the data center region your bucket's in.\n2.  For the **Region**, enter the region your bucket's located in, for example, `nyc3`.\n    *   If you plan to use this credential to create new Spaces, enter `us-east-1` instead.\n3.  From your DigitalOceans control panel, go to [**API**](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/spaces).\n4.  Open the **Spaces Keys** tab.\n5.  Select **Generate New Key**.\n6.

Copy the **Secret** value and enter this as the **Secret Access Key** in n8n.\n    *   Refer to [Sharing Access to Buckets with Access Keys](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/how-to/manage-access/#access-keys) for more information on generating the key and secret.\n9.  Keep the **Force Path Style** toggle turned off unless you want to use subdomain/virtual calling format.\n10.  Decide how you want the n8n credential to handle SSL:\n    *   To respect SSL certificate validation, keep the default of **Ignore SSL Issues** turned off.\n    *   To connect even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn on **Ignore SSL Issues**.\n\nRefer to DigitalOcean's [Spaces API Reference Documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/spaces-api/) for more information.\n\n### Using Wasabi[#](#using-wasabi \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo configure the credential for use with Wasabi:\n\n1.  For the **S3 Endpoint**, enter the service URL for your bucket's region. Start it with `https://`.\n    *   Refer to [What are the service URLs for Wasabi's different storage regions?](https://knowledgebase.wasabi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015106031-What-are-the-service-URLs-for-Wasabi-s-different-storage-regions) to identify the correct URL.\n2.  For the **Region**, enter the region slug portion of the service URL. For example, if you entered `https://s3.us-east-2.wasabisys.com` as the **S3 Endpoint**, `us-east-2` is the region.\n3.  Log into you Wasabi Console as the root user.\n4.  Open the **Menu** and select **Access Keys**.\n5.  Select **CREATE NEW ACCESS KEY**.\n6.  Select whether the key is for the **Root User** or a **Sub-User** and select **CREATE**.\n7.  Copy the **Access Key** and enter it in n8n as the **Access Key ID**.\n8.

A workflow can contain multiple trigger nodes but with each execution, only one of them will execute, depending on the triggering event.\n\nThere are three types of trigger nodes in n8n:\n\n| Type | Description | Example Nodes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Webhook | Nodes for services that support webhooks. These nodes listen for events and trigger workflows in real time. | [Zendesk Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Zendesk), [Telegram Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Telegram), [Brevo Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Brevo) |\n| Polling | Nodes for services that don't support webhooks. These nodes periodically check for new data, triggering workflows when they detect updates. | [Airtable Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable), [Gmail Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Gmail), [Google Sheet Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Sheet), [RssFeed Read Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/RssFeedRead) |\n| Others | Nodes that handle real-time responses not related to HTTP requests or polling. This includes message queue nodes and time-based triggers. | [AMQP Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Amqp), [RabbitMQ Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/RabbitMQ), [MQTT Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/MQTT), [Schedule Trigger](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Schedule), [Email Trigger (IMAP)](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/EmailReadImap) |\n\n## Action nodes[#](#action-nodes \"Permanent link\")\n\nAction nodes perform operations as part of your workflow.

  "markdown": "# Choose a node building style\n\nn8n has two node-building styles, declarative and programmatic.\n\nYou should use the declarative style for most nodes. This style:\n\nThe main difference between the declarative and programmatic styles is how they handle incoming data and build API requests. The programmatic style requires an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request. The declarative style handles this using the `routing` key in the `operations` object. Refer to [Node base file](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) for more information on node parameters and the `execute()` method.\n\nTo understand the difference between the declarative and programmatic styles, compare the two code snippets below.

  "markdown": "# Node UI design | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-ui-design.md \"Edit this page\")\n\n## Design your node's user interface[#](#design-your-nodes-user-interface \"Permanent link\")\n\nMost nodes are a GUI (graphical user interface) representation of an API. Designing the interface means finding a user-friendly way to represent API endpoints and parameters. Directly translating an entire API into form fields in a node may not result in a good user experience.\n\nThis document provides design guidance and standards to follow. These guidelines are the same as those used by n8n. This helps provide a smooth and consistent user experience for users mixing community and built-in nodes.\n\n## Design guidance[#](#design-guidance \"Permanent link\")\n\nAll node's use n8n's [node UI elements](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/), so you don't need to consider style details such as colors, borders, and so on. However, it's still useful to go through a basic design process:\n\n*   Review the documentation for the API you're integrating. Ask yourself:\n    *   What can you leave out?\n    *   What can you simplify?\n    *   Which parts of the API are confusing? How can you help users understand them?\n*   Use a wireframe tool to try out your field layout. If you find your node has a lot of fields and is getting confusing, consider n8n's guidance on [showing and hiding fields](#showing-and-hiding-fields).\n\n## Standards[#](#standards \"Permanent link\")\n\n### UI text style[#](#ui-text-style \"Permanent link\")\n\n| Element | Style |\n| --- | --- |\n| Drop-down value | Title case |\n| Hint | Sentence case |\n| Info box | Sentence case. Don't use a period (`.`) for one-sentence information. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab. |\n| Node name | Title case |\n| Parameter name | Title case |\n| Subtitle | Title case |\n| Tooltip | Sentence case. Don't use a period (`.`) for one-sentence tooltips. Always use a period if there's more than one sentence. This field can include links, which should open in a new tab. |\n\n### UI text terminology[#](#ui-text-terminology \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   Use the same terminology as the service the node connects to. For example, a Notion node should refer to Notion blocks, not Notion paragraphs, because Notion calls these elements blocks. There are exceptions to this rule, usually to avoid technical terms (for example, refer to the guidance on [name and description for upsert operations](#upsert-operations)).\n*   Sometimes a service has different terms for something in its API and in its GUI. Use the GUI language in your node, as this is what most users are familiar with. If you think some users may need to refer to the service's API docs, consider including this information in a hint.\n*   Don't use technical jargon when there are simpler alternatives.\n*   Be consistent when naming things. For example, choose one of `directory` or `folder` then stick to it.\n\n### Node naming conventions[#](#node-naming-conventions \"Permanent link\")\n\n| Convention | Correct | Incorrect |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| If a node is a trigger node,  <br>the displayed name should have 'Trigger' at the end,  <br>with a space before. | Shopify Trigger | ShopifyTrigger, Shopify trigger |\n| Don't include 'node' in the name. | Asana | Asana Node, Asana node |\n\n### Showing and hiding fields[#](#showing-and-hiding-fields \"Permanent link\")\n\nFields can either be:\n\n*   Displayed when the node opens: use this for resources and operations, and required fields.\n*   Hidden in the **Optional fields** section until a user clicks on that section: use this for optional fields.\n\nProgressively disclose complexity: hide a field until any earlier fields it depends on have values. For example, if you have a **Filter by date** toggle, and a **Date to filter by** datepicker, don't display **Date to filter by** until the user enables **Filter by date**.\n\n### Conventions by field type[#](#conventions-by-field-type \"Permanent link\")\n\n#### Credentials[#](#credentials \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n automatically displays credential fields as the top fields in the node.\n\n#### Resources and operations[#](#resources-and-operations \"Permanent link\")\n\nAPIs usually involve doing something to data. For example, \"get all tasks.\" In this example, \"task\" is the resource, and \"get all\" is the operation.\n\nWhen your node has this resource and operation pattern, your first field should be **Resource**, and your second field should be **Operation**.\n\n#### Required fields[#](#required-fields \"Permanent link\")\n\nOrder fields by:\n\n*   Most important to least important.\n*   Scope: from broad to narrow. For example, you have fields for **Document**, **Page**, and **Text to insert**, put them in that order.\n\n#### Optional fields[#](#optional-fields \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   Order fields alphabetically. To group similar things together, you can rename them. For example, rename **Email** and **Secondary Email** to **Email (primary)** and **Email (secondary)**.\n*   If an optional field has a default value that the node uses when the value isn't set, load the field with that value. Explain this in the field description. For example, **Defaults to false**.\n*   Connected fields: if one optional fields is dependent on another, bundle them together. They should both be under a single option that shows both fields when selected.\n*   If you have a lot of optional fields, consider grouping them by theme.\n\n#### Help[#](#help \"Permanent link\")\n\nThere are five types of help built in to the GUI:\n\n*   Info boxes: yellow boxes that appear between fields. Refer to [UI elements | Notice](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/#notice) for more information.\n*   Use info boxes for essential information. Don't over-use them. By making them rare, they stand out more and grab the user's attention.\n*   Parameter hints: lines of text displayed beneath a user input field. Use this when there's something the user needs to know, but an info box would be excessive.\n*   Node hints: provide help in the input panel, output panel, or node details view. Refer to [UI elements | Hints](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/#hints) for more information.\n*   Tooltips: callouts that appear when the user hovers over the tooltip icon ![\"Screenshot of the tooltip icon. The icon is a ? in a grey circle\"](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/help-tooltip.png). Use tooltips for extra information that the user might need.\n*   You don't have to provide a tooltip for every field. Only add one if it contains useful information.\n*   When writing tooltips, think about what the user needs. Don't just copy-paste API parameter descriptions. If the description doesn't make sense, or has errors, improve it.\n*   Placeholder text: n8n can display placeholder text in a field where the user hasn't entered a value. This can help the user know what's expected in that field.\n\nInfo boxes, hints, and tooltips can contain links to more information.\n\n#### Errors[#](#errors \"Permanent link\")\n\nMake it clear which fields are required.\n\nAdd validation rules to fields if possible. For example, check for valid email patterns if the field expects an email.\n\nWhen displaying errors, make sure only the main error message displays in the red error title. More information should go in **Details**.\n\n#### Toggles[#](#toggles \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   Tooltips for binary states should start with something like **Whether to . . .** .\n*   You may need a list rather than a toggle:\n    *   Use toggles when it's clear what happens in a false state. For example, **Simplify Output?**. The alternative (don't simplify output) is clear.\n    *   Use a dropdown list with named options when you need more clarity. For example, **Append?**. What happens if you don't append is unclear (it could be that nothing happens, or information is overwritten, or discarded).\n\n#### Lists[#](#lists \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   Set default values for lists whenever possible. The default should be the most-used option.\n*   Sort list options alphabetically.\n*   You can include list option descriptions. Only add descriptions if they provide useful information.\n*   If there is an option like **All**, use the word **All**, not shorthand like **\\***.\n\n#### Trigger node inputs[#](#trigger-node-inputs \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen a trigger node has a parameter for specifying which events to trigger on:\n\n*   Name the parameter **Trigger on**.\n*   Don't include a tooltip.\n\n#### Subtitles[#](#subtitles \"Permanent link\")\n\nSet subtitles based on the values of the main parameters. For example:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `subtitle: '={{$parameter[\"operation\"] + \": \" + $parameter[\"resource\"]}}',` |\n\n#### IDs[#](#ids \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen performing an operation on a specific record, such as \"update a task comment\" you need a way to specify which record you want to change.\n\n*   Wherever possible, provide two ways to specify a record:\n    *   By choosing from a pre-populated list.

  "markdown": "# Task runners | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/configuration/task-runners.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nTask runners are a generic mechanism to execute tasks in a secure and performant way. They're used to execute user-provided JavaScript code in the [Code node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/).\n\nThis document describes how task runners work and how you can configure them.\n\nExperimental feature\n\nTask runners are currently in public beta testing and might contain undiscovered issues. We don't recommend using them with business critical workflows.\n\n## How it works[#](#how-it-works \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe task runner feature consists of three components: a task runner, a task broker, and a task requester.\n\n![Task runner overview](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/hosting/configuration/task-runner-concept.png)\n\nTask runners connect to the task broker using a websocket connection. A task requester submits a task request to the broker where an available task runner can pick it up for execution.\n\nThe runner executes the task and submits the results to the task requester. The task broker coordinates communication between the runner and the requester.\n\nThe n8n instance (main and worker) acts as the broker. The Code node in this case is the task requester.\n\n## Task runner modes[#](#task-runner-modes \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can use task runners in two different modes: internal and external.\n\n### Internal mode[#](#internal-mode \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn internal mode, the n8n instance launches the task runner as a child process. The n8n process monitors and manages the life cycle of the task runner. The task runner process shares the same `uid` and `gid` as n8n.\n\n### External mode[#](#external-mode \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn external mode, an external orchestrator (for example, Kubernetes) launches the task runner instead of n8n. Typically, this means you would configure the task runner to run as a side-car container next to n8n.\n\n![Task runner deployed as a side-car container](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/hosting/configuration/task-runner-external-mode.png)\n\nIn this mode, the orchestrator monitors and manages the life cycle of the task runner container. The task runner is fully isolated from the n8n instance.\n\nWhen using the [Queue mode](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/queue-mode), each n8n container (main and workers) needs to have its own task runner.\n\n## Setting up external mode[#](#setting-up-external-mode \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse the following details to configure task runners in external mode\n\n### Configuring n8n instance in external mode[#](#configuring-n8n-instance-in-external-mode \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can configure n8n to use external task runners by setting the following environment variables:\n\n| Environment variables | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true` | Enables task runners. |\n| `N8N_RUNNERS_MODE=external` | Use task runners in external mode. |\n| `N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN=<random secure shared secret>` | A shared secret task runners use to connect to the broker. |\n| `N8N_RUNNERS_BROKER_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0` | By default, the task broker only listens to localhost. When using multiple containers (for example, with Docker Compose), it needs to be able to accept external connections. |\n\nFor full list of environment variables see [task runner environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners/).\n\n### Configuring task runners in external mode[#](#configuring-task-runners-in-external-mode \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe task runner comes bundled within the n8n Docker image. The Docker image also includes the task runner launcher.\n\nThe launcher can start the runner on-demand, which means lower memory usage when there's no work needed, but a short delay (few hundred ms) in cold-start. The launcher also monitors the runner and restarts it in case of infinite loops or other issues.\n\nRun a task runner container from the n8n Docker image by setting the following properties:\n\n| Configuration | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `command` | `[\"/usr/local/bin/task-runner-launcher\", \"javascript\"]` |\n| `livenessProbe` | `GET /healthz`, port `5680` |\n\nSet the following environment variables for the container, adjusted to fit your needs:\n\n| Environment variables | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN=<random secure shared secret>` | The shared secret the task runner uses to connect to the broker. |\n| `N8N_RUNNERS_MAX_CONCURRENCY=5` | The number of concurrent tasks the runner can execute. |\n| `N8N_RUNNERS_TASK_BROKER_URI=localhost:5679` | The address of the task broker server within the n8n instance. |\n| `N8N_RUNNERS_AUTO_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT=15` | Number of seconds of inactivity to wait before shutting down the task runner process. The launcher will automatically start the runner again when there are new tasks to execute. Set to `0` to disable automatic shutdown. |\n| `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=<limit>` | The memory limit for the task runner Node.js process. This should be lower than the limit for container so that the runner runs out of memory before the container. That way, the launcher is able to monitor the runner. |\n| `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` | The [same default timezone as configured for the n8n instance](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/timezone-localization/). |\n\nFor full list of environment variables see [task runner environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/task-runners/)."

It's helpful if other people need to work with the code.\n\nThe file and directory structure of your node depends on:\n\n*   Your node's complexity.\n*   Whether you use node versioning.\n*   How many nodes you include in the npm package.\n\n## Required files and directories[#](#required-files-and-directories \"Permanent link\")\n\nYour node must include:\n\n*   A `package.json` file at the root of the project. This is required for any npm module.\n*   A `nodes` directory, containing the code for your node:\n    *   This directory must contain the [base file](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/), in the format `<node-name>.node.ts`. For example, `MyNode.node.ts`.\n    *   n8n recommends including a [codex file](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files/), containing metadata for your node. The codex filename must match the node base filename. For example, given a node base file named `MyNode.node.ts`, the codex name is `MyNode.node.json`.\n    *   The `nodes` directory can contain other files and subdirectories, including directories for versions, and node code split across more than one file to create a modular structure.\n*   A `credentials` directory, containing your credentials code. This code lives in a single [credentials file](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files/). The filename format is `<node-name>.credentials.ts`. For example, `MyNode.credentials.ts`.\n\n## Modular structure[#](#modular-structure \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can choose whether to place all your node's functionality in one file, or split it out into a base file and other modules, which the base file then imports. Unless your node is very simple, it's a best practice to split it out.\n\nA basic pattern is to separate out operations. Refer to the [HttpBin starter node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/tree/master/nodes/HttpBin) for an example of this.\n\nFor more complex nodes, n8n recommends a directory structure. Refer to the [Airtable node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable) or [Microsoft Outlook node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Microsoft/Outlook) as examples.\n\n*   `actions`: a directory containing sub-directories that represent resources.\n    *   Each sub-directory should contain two types of files:\n    *   An index file with resource description (named either `<resourceName>.resource.ts` or `index.ts`)\n    *   Files for operations `<operationName>.operation.ts`. These files should have two exports: `description` of the operation and an `execute` function.\n*   `methods`: an optional directory dynamic parameters' functions.\n*   `transport`: a directory containing the communication implementation.\n\n## Versioning[#](#versioning \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf your node has more than one version, and you're using full versioning, this makes the file structure more complex. You need a directory for each version, along with a base file that sets the default version. Refer to [Node versioning](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-versioning/) for more information on working with versions, including types of versioning.\n\n## Decide how many nodes to include in a package[#](#decide-how-many-nodes-to-include-in-a-package \"Permanent link\")\n\nThere are two possible setups when building a node:\n\n*   One node in one npm package.\n*   More than one node in a single npm package.\n\nn8n supports both approaches. If you include more than one node, each node should have its own directory in the `nodes` directory.\n\n## A best-practice example for programmatic nodes[#](#a-best-practice-example-for-programmatic-nodes \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n's built-in [Airtable node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Airtable) implements a modular structure and versioning, following recommended patterns."

  "markdown": "# Logging | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/logging-monitoring/logging.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nLogging is an important feature for debugging. n8n uses the [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) logging library.\n\nLog streaming\n\nn8n Self-hosted Enterprise tier includes [Log streaming](https://docs.n8n.io/log-streaming/), in addition to the logging options described in this document.\n\n## Setup[#](#setup \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo set up logging in n8n, you need to set the following environment variables (you can also set the values in the [configuration file](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/))\n\n| Setting in the configuration file | Using environment variables | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| n8n.log.level | N8N\\_LOG\\_LEVEL | The log output level. The available options are (from lowest to highest level) are error, warn, info, and debug. The default value is `info`. You can learn more about these options [here](#log-levels). |\n| n8n.log.output | N8N\\_LOG\\_OUTPUT | Where to output logs. The available options are `console` and `file`. Multiple values can be used separated by a comma (`,`). `console` is used by default. |\n| n8n.log.file.location | N8N\\_LOG\\_FILE\\_LOCATION | The log file location, used only if log output is set to file. By default, `<n8nFolderPath>/logs/n8n.log` is used. |\n| n8n.log.file.maxsize | N8N\\_LOG\\_FILE\\_SIZE\\_MAX | The maximum size (in MB) for each log file. By default, n8n uses 16 MB. |\n| n8n.log.file.maxcount | N8N\\_LOG\\_FILE\\_COUNT\\_MAX | The maximum number of log files to keep. The default value is 100. This value should be set when using workers. |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14 | `# Set the logging level to 'debug' export N8N_LOG_LEVEL=debug  # Set log output to both console and a log file export N8N_LOG_OUTPUT=console,file  # Set a save location for the log file export N8N_LOG_FILE_LOCATION=/home/jim/n8n/logs/n8n.log  # Set a 50 MB maximum size for each log file export N8N_LOG_FILE_MAXSIZE=50  # Set 60 as the maximum number of log files to be kept export N8N_LOG_FILE_MAXCOUNT=60` |\n\n### Log levels[#](#log-levels \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n uses standard log levels to report:\n\n*   `silent`: outputs nothing at all\n*   `error`: outputs only errors and nothing else\n*   `warn`: outputs errors and warning messages\n*   `info`: contains useful information about progress\n*   `debug`: the most verbose output. n8n outputs a lot of information to help you debug issues.\n\n## Development[#](#development \"Permanent link\")\n\nDuring development, adding log messages is a good practice. It assists in debugging errors. To configure logging for development, follow the guide below.\n\n### Implementation details[#](#implementation-details \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n uses the `LoggerProxy` class, located in the `workflow` package. Calling the `LoggerProxy.init()` by passing in an instance of `Logger`, initializes the class before the usage.\n\nThe initialization process happens only once. The [`start.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/commands/start.ts) file already does this process for you. If you are creating a new command from scratch, you need to initialize the `LoggerProxy` class.\n\nOnce the `Logger` implementation gets created in the `cli` package, it can be obtained by calling the `getInstance` convenience method from the exported module.\n\nCheck the [start.ts](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/commands/start.ts) file to learn more about how this process works.\n\n### Adding logs[#](#adding-logs \"Permanent link\")\n\nOnce the `LoggerProxy` class gets initialized in the project, you can import it to any other file and add logs.\n\nConvenience methods are provided for all logging levels, so new logs can be added whenever needed using the format `Logger.<logLevel>('<message>', ...meta)`, where `meta` represents any additional properties desired beyond `message`.\n\nIn the example above, we use the standard log levels described [above](#log-levels). The `message` argument is a string, and `meta` is a data object.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | ``// You have to import the LoggerProxy. We rename it to Logger to make it easier  import { \tLoggerProxy as Logger } from 'n8n-workflow';  // Info-level logging of a trigger function, with workflow name and workflow ID as additional metadata properties  Logger.info(`Polling trigger initiated for workflow \"${workflow.name}\"`, {workflowName: workflow.name, workflowId: workflow.id});`` |\n\nWhen creating new loggers, some useful standards to keep in mind are:\n\n*   Craft log messages to be as human-readable as possible. For example, always wrap names in quotes.\n*   Duplicating information in the log message and metadata, like workflow name in the above example, can be useful as messages are easier to search and metadata enables easier filtering.\n*   Include multiple IDs (for example, `executionId`, `workflowId`, and `sessionId`) throughout all logs.\n*   Use node types instead of node names (or both) as this is more consistent, and so easier to search.\n\n## Front-end logs[#](#front-end-logs \"Permanent link\")\n\nAs of now, front-end logs aren't available. Using `Logger` or `LoggerProxy` would yield errors in the `editor-ui` package. This functionality will get implemented in the future versions."

Before you begin, make sure this is the node style you need. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/) for more information.\n\n## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou need the following installed on your development machine:\n\n*   [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n*   Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).\n\nYou need some understanding of:\n\n*   JavaScript/TypeScript\n*   REST APIs\n*   git\n*   Expressions in n8n\n\n## Build your node[#](#build-your-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/). You'll create a node that implements one piece of SendGrid functionality: create a contact.\n\nExisting node\n\nn8n has a built-in SendGrid node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name.\n\n### Step 1: Set up the project[#](#step-1-set-up-the-project \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter.\n\nClone the repository and navigate into the directory:\n\n1.  [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate) from the template repository.\n2.  Clone your new repository:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-friendgrid cd n8n-nodes-friendgrid` |\n    \n\nThe starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files:\n\n*   `nodes/ExampleNode`\n*   `nodes/HTTPBin`\n*   `credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts`\n*   `credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts`\n\nNow create the following directories and files:\n\n`nodes/FriendGrid`  \n`nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.json`  \n`nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.ts`  \n`credentials/FriendGridApi.credentials.ts`\n\nThese are the key files required for any node. Refer to [Node file structure](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/) for more information on required files and recommended organization.\n\nNow install the project dependencies:\n\n### Step 2: Add an icon[#](#step-2-add-an-icon \"Permanent link\")\n\nSave the SendGrid SVG logo from [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/SendGrid/sendGrid.svg) as `friendGrid.svg` in `nodes/FriendGrid/`.\n\nn8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio.\n\nDon't reference Font Awesome\n\nIf you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image.\n\n### Step 3: Define the node in the base file[#](#step-3-define-the-node-in-the-base-file \"Permanent link\")\n\nEvery node must have a base file. Refer to [Node base file](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) for detailed information about base file parameters.\n\nIn this example, the file is `FriendGrid.node.ts`. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to [Node file structure](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/) for more information.\n\n#### Step 3.1: Imports[#](#step-31-imports \"Permanent link\")\n\nStart by adding the import statements:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14 | `import { \tIExecuteFunctions, } from 'n8n-core';  import { \tIDataObject, \tINodeExecutionData, \tINodeType, \tINodeTypeDescription, } from 'n8n-workflow';  import { \tOptionsWithUri, } from 'request';` |\n\n#### Step 3.2: Create the main class[#](#step-32-create-the-main-class \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe node must export an interface that implements `INodeType`. This interface must include a `description` interface, which in turn contains the `properties` array.\n\nClass names and file names\n\nMake sure the class name and the file name match. For example, given a class `FriendGrid`, the filename must be `FriendGrid.node.ts`.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `export class FriendGrid implements INodeType { \tdescription: INodeTypeDescription = { \t\t// Basic node details will go here \t\tproperties: [ \t\t\t// Resources and operations will go here \t\t], \t}; \t// The execute method will go here \tasync execute(this: IExecuteFunctions): Promise<INodeExecutionData[][]> { \t} }` |\n\n#### Step 3.3: Add node details[#](#step-33-add-node-details \"Permanent link\")\n\nAll programmatic nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name and icon. Add the following to the `description`:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17 | `displayName: 'FriendGrid', name: 'friendGrid', icon: 'file:friendGrid.svg', group: ['transform'], version: 1, description: 'Consume SendGrid API', defaults: { \tname: 'FriendGrid', }, inputs: ['main'], outputs: ['main'], credentials: [ \t{ \t\tname: 'friendGridApi', \t\trequired: true, \t}, ],` |\n\nn8n uses some of the properties set in `description` to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are `displayName`, `icon`, and `description`.\n\n#### Step 3.4: Add the resource[#](#step-34-add-the-resource \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access one of SendGrid's API endpoints: `/v3/marketing/contacts`. This means you need to define a resource for this endpoint. Update the `properties` array with the resource object:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15 | `{ \tdisplayName: 'Resource', \tname: 'resource', \ttype: 'options', \toptions: [ \t\t{ \t\t\tname: 'Contact', \t\t\tvalue: 'contact', \t\t}, \t], \tdefault: 'contact', \tnoDataExpression: true, \trequired: true, \tdescription: 'Create a new contact', },` |\n\n`type` controls which UI element n8n displays for the resource, and tells n8n what type of data to expect from the user. `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/) for more information.\n\n#### Step 3.5: Add operations[#](#step-35-add-operations \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe operations object defines what you can do with a resource. It usually relates to REST API verbs (GET, POST, and so on). In this tutorial, there's one operation: create a contact. It has one required field, the email address for the contact the user creates.\n\nAdd the following to the `properties` array, after the `resource` object:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29<br>30<br>31<br>32<br>33<br>34<br>35<br>36<br>37<br>38<br>39<br>40<br>41 | `{ \tdisplayName: 'Operation', \tname: 'operation', \ttype: 'options', \tdisplayOptions: { \t\tshow: { \t\t\tresource: [ \t\t\t\t'contact', \t\t\t], \t\t}, \t}, \toptions: [ \t\t{ \t\t\tname: 'Create', \t\t\tvalue: 'create', \t\t\tdescription: 'Create a contact', \t\t\taction: 'Create a contact', \t\t}, \t], \tdefault: 'create', \tnoDataExpression: true, }, { \tdisplayName: 'Email', \tname: 'email', \ttype: 'string', \trequired: true, \tdisplayOptions: { \t\tshow: { \t\t\toperation: [ \t\t\t\t'create', \t\t\t], \t\t\tresource: [ \t\t\t\t'contact', \t\t\t], \t\t}, \t}, \tdefault:'', \tplaceholder: 'name@email.com', \tdescription:'Primary email for the contact', },` |\n\n#### Step 3.6: Add optional fields[#](#step-36-add-optional-fields \"Permanent link\")\n\nMost APIs, including the SendGrid API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under **Additional Fields** in the UI.\n\nFor this tutorial, you'll add two additional fields, to allow users to enter the contact's first name and last name. Add the following to the properties array:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29<br>30<br>31 | `{ \tdisplayName: 'Additional Fields', \tname: 'additionalFields', \ttype: 'collection', \tplaceholder: 'Add Field', \tdefault: {}, \tdisplayOptions: { \t\tshow: { \t\t\tresource: [ \t\t\t\t'contact', \t\t\t], \t\t\toperation: [ \t\t\t\t'create', \t\t\t], \t\t}, \t}, \toptions: [ \t\t{ \t\t\tdisplayName: 'First Name', \t\t\tname: 'firstName', \t\t\ttype: 'string', \t\t\tdefault: '', \t\t}, \t\t{ \t\t\tdisplayName: 'Last Name', \t\t\tname: 'lastName', \t\t\ttype: 'string', \t\t\tdefault: '', \t\t}, \t], },` |\n\n### Step 4: Add the execute method[#](#step-4-add-the-execute-method \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou've set up the node UI and basic information. It's time to map the node UI to API requests, and make the node actually do something.\n\nThe `execute` method runs every time the node runs. In this method, you have access to the input items and to the parameters that the user set in the UI, including the credentials.\n\nAdd the following the `execute` method in the `FriendGrid.node.ts`:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29<br>30<br>31<br>32<br>33<br>34<br>35<br>36<br>37<br>38<br>39<br>40<br>41<br>42 | ``// Handle data coming from previous nodes const items = this.getInputData(); let responseData; const returnData = []; const resource = this.getNodeParameter('resource', 0) as string; const operation = this.getNodeParameter('operation', 0) as string;  // For each item, make an API call to create a contact for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) { \tif (resource === 'contact') { \t\tif (operation === 'create') { \t\t\t// Get email input \t\t\tconst email = this.getNodeParameter('email', i) as string; \t\t\t// Get additional fields input \t\t\tconst additionalFields = this.getNodeParameter('additionalFields', i) as IDataObject; \t\t\tconst data: IDataObject = { \t\t\t\temail, \t\t\t};  \t\t\tObject.assign(data, additionalFields);  \t\t\t// Make HTTP request according to https://sendgrid.com/docs/api-reference/ \t\t\tconst options: OptionsWithUri = { \t\t\t\theaders: { \t\t\t\t\t'Accept': 'application/json', \t\t\t\t}, \t\t\t\tmethod: 'PUT', \t\t\t\tbody: { \t\t\t\t\tcontacts: [ \t\t\t\t\t\tdata, \t\t\t\t\t], \t\t\t\t}, \t\t\t\turi: `https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/marketing/contacts`, \t\t\t\tjson: true, \t\t\t}; \t\t\tresponseData = await this.helpers.requestWithAuthentication.call(this, 'friendGridApi', options); \t\t\treturnData.push(responseData); \t\t} \t} } // Map data to n8n data structure return [this.helpers.returnJsonArray(returnData)];`` |\n\nNote the following lines of this code:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `const items = this.getInputData(); ...  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) { \t... \tconst email = this.getNodeParameter('email', i) as string; \t... }` |\n\nUsers can provide data in two ways:\n\n*   Entered directly in the node fields\n*   By mapping data from earlier nodes in the workflow\n\n`getInputData()`, and the subsequent loop, allows the node to handle situations where data comes from a previous node. This includes supporting multiple inputs. This means that if, for example, the previous node outputs contact information for five people, your FriendGrid node can create five contacts.\n\n### Step 5: Set up authentication[#](#step-5-set-up-authentication \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe SendGrid API requires users to authenticate with an API key.\n\nAdd the following to `FriendGridApi.credentials.ts`\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29<br>30<br>31<br>32<br>33<br>34<br>35 | `import { \tIAuthenticateGeneric, \tICredentialTestRequest, \tICredentialType, \tINodeProperties, } from 'n8n-workflow';  export class FriendGridApi implements ICredentialType { \tname = 'friendGridApi'; \tdisplayName = 'FriendGrid API'; \tproperties: INodeProperties[] = [ \t\t{ \t\t\tdisplayName: 'API Key', \t\t\tname: 'apiKey', \t\t\ttype: 'string', \t\t\tdefault: '', \t\t}, \t];  \tauthenticate: IAuthenticateGeneric = { \t\ttype: 'generic', \t\tproperties: { \t\t\theaders: { \t\t\t\tAuthorization: '=Bearer {{$credentials.apiKey}}', \t\t\t}, \t\t}, \t};  \ttest: ICredentialTestRequest = { \t\trequest: { \t\t\tbaseURL: 'https://api.sendgrid.com/v3', \t\t\turl: '/marketing/contacts', \t\t}, \t}; }` |\n\nFor more information about credentials files and options, refer to [Credentials file](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files/).\n\n### Step 6: Add node metadata[#](#step-6-add-node-metadata \"Permanent link\")\n\nMetadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is `FriendGrid.node.json`.\n\nAdd the following code to the JSON file:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20 | `{ \t\"node\": \"n8n-nodes-base.FriendGrid\", \t\"nodeVersion\": \"1.0\", \t\"codexVersion\": \"1.0\", \t\"categories\": [ \t\t\"Miscellaneous\" \t], \t\"resources\": { \t\t\"credentialDocumentation\": [ \t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\"url\": \"\" \t\t\t} \t\t], \t\t\"primaryDocumentation\": [ \t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\"url\": \"\" \t\t\t} \t\t] \t} }` |\n\nFor more information on these parameters, refer to [Node codex files](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files/).\n\n### Step 7: Update the npm package details[#](#step-7-update-the-npm-package-details \"Permanent link\")\n\nYour npm package details are in the `package.json` at the root of the project. It's essential to include the `n8n` object with links to the credentials and base node file. Update this file to include the following information:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29<br>30<br>31<br>32<br>33<br>34<br>35<br>36<br>37<br>38<br>39<br>40<br>41<br>42<br>43<br>44<br>45 | `{ \t// All node names must start with \"n8n-nodes-\" \t\"name\": \"n8n-nodes-friendgrid\", \t\"version\": \"0.1.0\", \t\"description\": \"n8n node to create contacts in SendGrid\", \t\"keywords\": [ \t\t// This keyword is required for community nodes \t\t\"n8n-community-node-package\" \t], \t\"license\": \"MIT\", \t\"homepage\": \"https://n8n.io\", \t\"author\": { \t\t\"name\": \"Test\", \t\t\"email\": \"test@example.com\" \t}, \t\"repository\": { \t\t\"type\": \"git\", \t\t// Change the git remote to your own repository \t\t// Add the new URL here \t\t\"url\": \"git+<your-repo-url>\" \t}, \t\"main\": \"index.js\", \t\"scripts\": { \t\t// don't change \t}, \t\"files\": [ \t\t\"dist\" \t], \t// Link the credentials and node \t\"n8n\": { \t\t\"n8nNodesApiVersion\": 1, \t\t\"credentials\": [ \t\t\t\"dist/credentials/FriendGridApi.credentials.js\" \t\t], \t\t\"nodes\": [ \t\t\t\"dist/nodes/FriendGrid/FriendGrid.node.js\" \t\t] \t}, \t\"devDependencies\": { \t\t// don't change \t}, \t\"peerDependencies\": { \t\t// don't change \t} }` |\n\nYou need to update the `package.json` to include your own information, such as your name and repository URL. For more information on npm `package.json` files, refer to [npm's package.json documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json).\n\n## Test your node[#](#test-your-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.\n\n1.  Install n8n using npm:\n2.  When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `# In your node directory npm run build npm link` |\n    \n3.  Install the node into your local n8n instance:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `# In the nodes directory within your n8n installation # node-package-name is the name from the package.json npm link <node-package-name>` |\n    \n    Check your directory\n    \n    Make sure you run `npm link <node-name>` in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be:\n    \n    *   `~/.n8n/custom/`\n    *   `~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>`: if your n8n installation set a different name using `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`.\n    \n4.  Start n8n:\n    \n5.  Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel.\n    \n    Node names\n    \n    Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is `n8n-nodes-weather-nodes`, and the package contains nodes named `rain`, `sun`, `snow`, you should search for `rain`, not `weather-nodes`.\n    \n\n### Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   There's no `custom` directory in `~/.n8n` local installation.\n\nYou have to create `custom` directory manually and run `npm init`\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `# In ~/.n8n directory run mkdir custom  cd custom  npm init` |\n\n## Next steps[#](#next-steps \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   [Deploy your node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/).\n*   View an example of a programmatic node: n8n's [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost).

  "markdown": "# Tutorial: Build a declarative-style node\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nThis tutorial walks through building a declarative-style node. Before you begin, make sure this is the node style you need. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/) for more information.\n\n## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou need the following installed on your development machine:\n\n*   [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n*   Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).\n\nYou need some understanding of:\n\n*   JavaScript/TypeScript\n*   REST APIs\n*   git\n\n## Build your node[#](#build-your-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn this section, you'll clone n8n's node starter repository, and build a node that integrates the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/). You'll create a node that uses two of NASA's services: APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) and Mars Rover Photos. To keep the code examples short, the node won't implement every available option for the Mars Rover Photos endpoint.\n\nExisting node\n\nn8n has a built-in NASA node. To avoid clashing with the existing node, you'll give your version a different name.\n\n### Step 1: Set up the project[#](#step-1-set-up-the-project \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n provides a starter repository for node development. Using the starter ensures you have all necessary dependencies. It also provides a linter.\n\nClone the repository and navigate into the directory:\n\n1.  [Generate a new repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/generate) from the template repository.\n2.  Clone your new repository:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/<your-repo-name>.git n8n-nodes-nasa-pics cd n8n-nodes-nasa-pics` |\n    \n\nThe starter contains example nodes and credentials. Delete the following directories and files:\n\n*   `nodes/ExampleNode`\n*   `nodes/HTTPBin`\n*   `credentials/ExampleCredentials.credentials.ts`\n*   `credentials/HttpBinApi.credentials.ts`\n\nNow create the following directories and files:\n\n`nodes/NasaPics`  \n`nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.json`  \n`nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.ts`  \n`credentials/NasaPicsApi.credentials.ts`\n\nThese are the key files required for any node. Refer to [Node file structure](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/) for more information on required files and recommended organization.\n\nNow install the project dependencies:\n\n### Step 2: Add an icon[#](#step-2-add-an-icon \"Permanent link\")\n\nSave the NASA SVG logo from [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/NASA_logo.svg) as `nasapics.svg` in `nodes/NasaPics/`.\n\nn8n recommends using an SVG for your node icon, but you can also use PNG. If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio.\n\nDon't reference Font Awesome\n\nIf you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image.\n\n### Step 3: Create the node[#](#step-3-create-the-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nEvery node must have a base file. Refer to [Node base file](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/) for detailed information about base file parameters.\n\nIn this example, the file is `NasaPics.node.ts`. To keep this tutorial short, you'll place all the node functionality in this one file. When building more complex nodes, you should consider splitting out your functionality into modules. Refer to [Node file structure](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-file-structure/) for more information.\n\n#### Step 3.1: Imports[#](#step-31-imports \"Permanent link\")\n\nStart by adding the import statements:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `import { INodeType, INodeTypeDescription } from 'n8n-workflow';` |\n\n#### Step 3.2: Create the main class[#](#step-32-create-the-main-class \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe node must export an interface that implements INodeType. This interface must include a `description` interface, which in turn contains the `properties` array.\n\nClass names and file names\n\nMake sure the class name and the file name match. For example, given a class `NasaPics`, the filename must be `NasaPics.node.ts`.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `export class NasaPics implements INodeType { \tdescription: INodeTypeDescription = { \t\t// Basic node details will go here \t\tproperties: [ \t\t// Resources and operations will go here \t\t] \t}; }` |\n\n#### Step 3.3: Add node details[#](#step-33-add-node-details \"Permanent link\")\n\nAll nodes need some basic parameters, such as their display name, icon, and the basic information for making a request using the node. Add the following to the `description`:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25 | `displayName: 'NASA Pics', name: 'NasaPics', icon: 'file:nasapics.svg', group: ['transform'], version: 1, subtitle: '={{$parameter[\"operation\"] + \": \" + $parameter[\"resource\"]}}', description: 'Get data from NASAs API', defaults: { \tname: 'NASA Pics', }, inputs: ['main'], outputs: ['main'], credentials: [ \t{ \t\tname: 'NasaPicsApi', \t\trequired: true, \t}, ], requestDefaults: { \tbaseURL: 'https://api.nasa.gov', \theaders: { \t\tAccept: 'application/json', \t\t'Content-Type': 'application/json', \t}, },` |\n\nn8n uses some of the properties set in `description` to render the node in the Editor UI. These properties are `displayName`, `icon`, `description`, and `subtitle`.\n\n#### Step 3.4: Add resources[#](#step-34-add-resources \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe resource object defines the API resource that the node uses. In this tutorial, you're creating a node to access two of NASA's API endpoints: `planetary/apod` and `mars-photos`. This means you need to define two resource options in `NasaPics.node.ts`.

Refer to [Node UI elements](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/) for more information.\n\n#### Step 3.5: Add operations[#](#step-35-add-operations \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe operations object defines the available operations on a resource.\n\nIn a declarative-style node, the operations object includes `routing` (within the `options` array). This sets up the details of the API call.\n\nAdd the following to the `properties` array, after the `resource` object:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br>  2<br>  3<br>  4<br>  5<br>  6<br>  7<br>  8<br>  9<br> 10<br> 11<br> 12<br> 13<br> 14<br> 15<br> 16<br> 17<br> 18<br> 19<br> 20<br> 21<br> 22<br> 23<br> 24<br> 25<br> 26<br> 27<br> 28<br> 29<br> 30<br> 31<br> 32<br> 33<br> 34<br> 35<br> 36<br> 37<br> 38<br> 39<br> 40<br> 41<br> 42<br> 43<br> 44<br> 45<br> 46<br> 47<br> 48<br> 49<br> 50<br> 51<br> 52<br> 53<br> 54<br> 55<br> 56<br> 57<br> 58<br> 59<br> 60<br> 61<br> 62<br> 63<br> 64<br> 65<br> 66<br> 67<br> 68<br> 69<br> 70<br> 71<br> 72<br> 73<br> 74<br> 75<br> 76<br> 77<br> 78<br> 79<br> 80<br> 81<br> 82<br> 83<br> 84<br> 85<br> 86<br> 87<br> 88<br> 89<br> 90<br> 91<br> 92<br> 93<br> 94<br> 95<br> 96<br> 97<br> 98<br> 99<br>100<br>101<br>102<br>103<br>104<br>105 | `{ \tdisplayName: 'Operation', \tname: 'operation', \ttype: 'options', \tnoDataExpression: true, \tdisplayOptions: { \t\tshow: { \t\t\tresource: [ \t\t\t\t'astronomyPictureOfTheDay', \t\t\t], \t\t}, \t}, \toptions: [ \t\t{ \t\t\tname: 'Get', \t\t\tvalue: 'get', \t\t\taction: 'Get the APOD', \t\t\tdescription: 'Get the Astronomy Picture of the day', \t\t\trouting: { \t\t\t\trequest: { \t\t\t\t\tmethod: 'GET', \t\t\t\t\turl: '/planetary/apod', \t\t\t\t}, \t\t\t}, \t\t}, \t], \tdefault: 'get', }, { \tdisplayName: 'Operation', \tname: 'operation', \ttype: 'options', \tnoDataExpression: true, \tdisplayOptions: { \t\tshow: { \t\t\tresource: [ \t\t\t\t'marsRoverPhotos', \t\t\t], \t\t}, \t}, \toptions: [ \t\t{ \t\t\tname: 'Get', \t\t\tvalue: 'get', \t\t\taction: 'Get Mars Rover photos', \t\t\tdescription: 'Get photos from the Mars Rover', \t\t\trouting: { \t\t\t\trequest: { \t\t\t\t\tmethod: 'GET', \t\t\t\t}, \t\t\t}, \t\t}, \t], \tdefault: 'get', }, { \tdisplayName: 'Rover name', \tdescription: 'Choose which Mars Rover to get a photo from', \trequired: true, \tname: 'roverName', \ttype: 'options', \toptions: [ \t\t{name: 'Curiosity', value: 'curiosity'}, \t\t{name: 'Opportunity', value: 'opportunity'}, \t\t{name: 'Perseverance', value: 'perseverance'}, \t\t{name: 'Spirit', value: 'spirit'}, \t], \trouting: { \t\trequest: { \t\t\turl: '=/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/{{$value}}/photos', \t\t}, \t}, \tdefault: 'curiosity', \tdisplayOptions: { \t\tshow: { \t\t\tresource: [ \t\t\t\t'marsRoverPhotos', \t\t\t], \t\t}, \t}, }, { \tdisplayName: 'Date', \tdescription: 'Earth date', \trequired: true, \tname: 'marsRoverDate', \ttype: 'dateTime', \tdefault:'', \tdisplayOptions: { \t\tshow: { \t\t\tresource: [ \t\t\t\t'marsRoverPhotos', \t\t\t], \t\t}, \t}, \trouting: { \t\trequest: { \t\t\t// You've already set up the URL. qs appends the value of the field as a query string \t\t\tqs: { \t\t\t\tearth_date: '={{ new Date($value).toISOString().substr(0,10) }}', \t\t\t}, \t\t}, \t}, }, // Optional/additional fields will go here` |\n\nThis code creates two operations: one to get today's APOD image, and another to send a get request for photos from one of the Mars Rovers. The object named `roverName` requires the user to choose which Rover they want photos from. The `routing` object in the Mars Rover operation references this to create the URL for the API call.\n\n#### Step 3.6: Optional fields[#](#step-36-optional-fields \"Permanent link\")\n\nMost APIs, including the NASA API that you're using in this example, have optional fields you can use to refine your query.\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, n8n displays these under **Additional Fields** in the UI.\n\nFor this tutorial, you'll add one additional field, to allow users to pick a date to use with the APOD endpoint. Add the following to the properties array:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29<br>30<br>31<br>32<br>33 | `{ \tdisplayName: 'Additional Fields', \tname: 'additionalFields', \ttype: 'collection', \tdefault: {}, \tplaceholder: 'Add Field', \tdisplayOptions: { \t\tshow: { \t\t\tresource: [ \t\t\t\t'astronomyPictureOfTheDay', \t\t\t], \t\t\toperation: [ \t\t\t\t'get', \t\t\t], \t\t}, \t}, \toptions: [ \t\t{ \t\t\tdisplayName: 'Date', \t\t\tname: 'apodDate', \t\t\ttype: 'dateTime', \t\t\tdefault: '', \t\t\trouting: { \t\t\t\trequest: { \t\t\t\t\t// You've already set up the URL. qs appends the value of the field as a query string \t\t\t\t\tqs: { \t\t\t\t\t\tdate: '={{ new Date($value).toISOString().substr(0,10) }}', \t\t\t\t\t}, \t\t\t\t}, \t\t\t}, \t\t}, \t],\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t }` |\n\n### Step 4: Set up authentication[#](#step-4-set-up-authentication \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe NASA API requires users to authenticate with an API key.\n\nAdd the following to `nasaPicsApi.credentials.ts`:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29 | `import { \tIAuthenticateGeneric, \tICredentialType, \tINodeProperties, } from 'n8n-workflow';  export class NasaPicsApi implements ICredentialType { \tname = 'NasaPicsApi'; \tdisplayName = 'NASA Pics API'; \t// Uses the link to this tutorial as an example \t// Replace with your own docs links when building your own nodes \tdocumentationUrl = 'https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/'; \tproperties: INodeProperties[] = [ \t\t{ \t\t\tdisplayName: 'API Key', \t\t\tname: 'apiKey', \t\t\ttype: 'string', \t\t\tdefault: '', \t\t}, \t]; \tauthenticate = { \t\ttype: 'generic', \t\tproperties: { \t\t\tqs: { \t\t\t\t'api_key': '={{$credentials.apiKey}}' \t\t\t} \t\t}, \t} as IAuthenticateGeneric; }` |\n\nFor more information about credentials files and options, refer to [Credentials file](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/credentials-files/).\n\n### Step 5: Add node metadata[#](#step-5-add-node-metadata \"Permanent link\")\n\nMetadata about your node goes in the JSON file at the root of your node. n8n refers to this as the codex file. In this example, the file is `NasaPics.node.json`.\n\nAdd the following code to the JSON file:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20 | `{ \t\"node\": \"n8n-nodes-base.NasaPics\", \t\"nodeVersion\": \"1.0\", \t\"codexVersion\": \"1.0\", \t\"categories\": [ \t\t\"Miscellaneous\" \t], \t\"resources\": { \t\t\"credentialDocumentation\": [ \t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\"url\": \"\" \t\t\t} \t\t], \t\t\"primaryDocumentation\": [ \t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\"url\": \"\" \t\t\t} \t\t] \t} }` |\n\nFor more information on these parameters, refer to [Node codex files](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-codex-files/).\n\n### Step 6: Update the npm package details[#](#step-6-update-the-npm-package-details \"Permanent link\")\n\nYour npm package details are in the `package.json` at the root of the project. It's essential to include the `n8n` object with links to the credentials and base node file. Update this file to include the following information:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29<br>30<br>31<br>32<br>33<br>34<br>35<br>36<br>37<br>38<br>39<br>40<br>41<br>42<br>43<br>44<br>45 | `{ \t// All node names must start with \"n8n-nodes-\" \t\"name\": \"n8n-nodes-nasapics\", \t\"version\": \"0.1.0\", \t\"description\": \"n8n node to call NASA's APOD and Mars Rover Photo services.\", \t\"keywords\": [ \t\t// This keyword is required for community nodes \t\t\"n8n-community-node-package\" \t], \t\"license\": \"MIT\", \t\"homepage\": \"https://n8n.io\", \t\"author\": { \t\t\"name\": \"Test\", \t\t\"email\": \"test@example.com\" \t}, \t\"repository\": { \t\t\"type\": \"git\", \t\t// Change the git remote to your own repository \t\t// Add the new URL here \t\t\"url\": \"git+<your-repo-url>\" \t}, \t\"main\": \"index.js\", \t\"scripts\": { \t\t// don't change \t}, \t\"files\": [ \t\t\"dist\" \t], \t// Link the credentials and node \t\"n8n\": { \t\t\"n8nNodesApiVersion\": 1, \t\t\"credentials\": [ \t\t\t\"dist/credentials/NasaPicsApi.credentials.js\" \t\t], \t\t\"nodes\": [ \t\t\t\"dist/nodes/NasaPics/NasaPics.node.js\" \t\t] \t}, \t\"devDependencies\": { \t\t// don't change \t}, \t\"peerDependencies\": { \t\t// don't change \t} }` |\n\nYou need to update the `package.json` to include your own information, such as your name and repository URL. For more information on npm `package.json` files, refer to [npm's package.json documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json).\n\n## Test your node[#](#test-your-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can test your node as you build it by running it in a local n8n instance.\n\n1.  Install n8n using npm:\n2.  When you are ready to test your node, publish it locally:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `# In your node directory npm run build npm link` |\n    \n3.  Install the node into your local n8n instance:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `# In the nodes directory within your n8n installation # node-package-name is the name from the package.json npm link <node-package-name>` |\n    \n    Check your directory\n    \n    Make sure you run `npm link <node-name>` in the nodes directory within your n8n installation. This can be:\n    \n    *   `~/.n8n/custom/`\n    *   `~/.n8n/<your-custom-name>`: if your n8n installation set a different name using `N8N_CUSTOM_EXTENSIONS`.\n    \n4.  Start n8n:\n    \n5.  Open n8n in your browser. You should see your nodes when you search for them in the nodes panel.\n    \n    Node names\n    \n    Make sure you search using the node name, not the package name. For example, if your npm package name is `n8n-nodes-weather-nodes`, and the package contains nodes named `rain`, `sun`, `snow`, you should search for `rain`, not `weather-nodes`.\n    \n\n### Troubleshooting[#](#troubleshooting \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   There's no `custom` directory in `~/.n8n` local installation.\n\nYou have to create `custom` directory manually and run `npm init`\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `# In ~/.n8n directory run mkdir custom  cd custom  npm init` |\n\n## Next steps[#](#next-steps \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   [Deploy your node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/deploy/).\n*   View an example of a declarative node: n8n's [Brevo node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Brevo).

It describes the factors that affect performance, and includes two example benchmarks.\n\n## Performance factors[#](#performance-factors \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe performance of n8n depends on factors including:\n\n*   The workflow type\n*   The resources available to n8n\n*   How you configure n8n's scaling options\n\n## Run your own benchmarking[#](#run-your-own-benchmarking \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo get an accurate estimate for your use case, run n8n's [benchmarking framework](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/%40n8n/benchmark). The repository contains more information about the benchmarking.\n\n## Example: Single instance performance[#](#example-single-instance-performance \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis test measures how response time increases as requests per second increase. It looks at the response time when calling the Webhook Trigger node.\n\nSetup:\n\n*   Hardware: ECS c5a.large instance (4GB RAM)\n*   n8n setup: Single n8n instance (running in main mode, with Postgres database)\n*   Workflow: Webhook Trigger node, Edit Fields node\n\n![Graph showing n8n response times by requests per second](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/hosting/scaling/benchmarking-single-instance-100-250.png)\n\nThis graph shows the percentage of requests to the Webhook Trigger node getting a response within 100 seconds, and how that varies with load. Under higher loads n8n usually still processes the data, but takes over 100s to respond.\n\n## Example: Multi-instance performance[#](#example-multi-instance-performance \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis test measures how response time increases as requests per second increase. It looks at the response time when calling the Webhook Trigger node.\n\nSetup:\n\n*   Hardware: seven ECS c5a.4xlarge instances (8GB RAM each)\n*   n8n setup: two webhook instances, four worker instances, one database instance (MySQL), one main instance running n8n and Redis\n*   Workflow: Webhook Trigger node, Edit Fields node\n*   Multi-instance setups use [Queue mode](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/)\n\n![Graph showing n8n response times by requests per second](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/hosting/scaling/benchmarking-multi-instance-500-2500.png)\n\nThis graph shows the percentage of requests to the Webhook Trigger node getting a response within 100 seconds, and how that varies with load.

  "markdown": "# Configuring queue mode | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/scaling/queue-mode.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nYou can run n8n in different modes depending on your needs. The queue mode provides the best scalability.\n\nBinary data storage\n\nn8n doesn't support queue mode with binary data storage in filesystem. If your workflows need to persist binary data in queue mode, you can use [S3 external storage](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/external-storage/).\n\n## How it works[#](#how-it-works \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen running in queue mode, you have multiple n8n instances set up, with one main instance receiving workflow information (such as triggers) and the worker instances performing the executions.\n\nEach worker is its own Node.js instance, running in `main` mode, but able to handle multiple simultaneous workflow executions due to their high IOPS (input-output operations per second).\n\nBy using worker instances and running in queue mode, you can scale n8n up (by adding workers) and down (by removing workers) as needed to handle the workload.\n\nThis is the process flow:\n\n1.  The main n8n instance handles timers and webhook calls, generating (but not running) a workflow execution.\n2.  It passes the execution ID to a message broker, [Redis](#start-redis), which maintains the queue of pending executions and allows the next available worker to pick them up.\n3.  A worker in the pool picks up message from Redis.\n4.  The worker uses the execution ID to get workflow information from the database.\n5.  After completing the workflow execution, the worker:\n    *   Writes the results to the database.\n    *   Posts to Redis, saying that the execution has finished.\n6.  Redis notifies the main instance.\n\n![\"Diagram showing the flow of data between the main n8n instance, Redis, the n8n workers, and the n8n database\"](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/hosting/scaling/queue-mode-flow.png)\n\n## Configuring workers[#](#configuring-workers \"Permanent link\")\n\nWorkers are n8n instances that do the actual work. They receive information from the main n8n process about the workflows that have to get executed, execute the workflows, and update the status after each execution is complete.\n\n### Set encryption key[#](#set-encryption-key \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n automatically generates an encryption key upon first startup. You can also provide your own custom key using [environment variable](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) if desired.\n\nThe encryption key of the main n8n instance must be shared with all worker and webhooks processor nodes to ensure these worker nodes are able to access credentials stored in the database.\n\nSet the encryption key for each worker node in a [configuration file](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-methods/) or by setting the corresponding environment variable:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `export N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<main_instance_encryption_key>` |\n\n### Set executions mode[#](#set-executions-mode \"Permanent link\")\n\nDatabase considerations\n\nn8n recommends using Postgres 13+. Running n8n with execution mode set to `queue` with an SQLite database isn't recommended.\n\nSet the environment variable `EXECUTIONS_MODE` to `queue` using the following command.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `export EXECUTIONS_MODE=queue` |\n\nAlternatively, you can set `executions.mode` to `queue` in the [configuration file](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/).\n\n### Start Redis[#](#start-redis \"Permanent link\")\n\nRunning Redis on a separate machine\n\nYou can run Redis on a separate machine, just make sure that it's accessible by the n8n instance.\n\nTo run Redis in a Docker container, follow the instructions below:\n\nRun the following command to start a Redis instance:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `docker run --name some-redis -p 6379:6379  -d redis` |\n\nBy default, Redis runs on `localhost` on port `6379` with no password. Based on your Redis configuration, set the following configurations for the main n8n process. These will allow n8n to interact with Redis.\n\n| Using configuration file | Using environment variables | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `queue.bull.redis.host:localhost` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_HOST=localhost` | By default, Redis runs on `localhost`. |\n| `queue.bull.redis.port:6379` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PORT=6379` | The default port is `6379`. If Redis is running on a different port, configure the value. |\n\nYou can also set the following optional configurations:\n\n| Using configuration file | Using environment variables | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `queue.bull.redis.username:USERNAME` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_USERNAME` | By default, Redis doesn't require a username. If you're using a specific user, configure it variable. |\n| `queue.bull.redis.password:PASSWORD` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PASSWORD` | By default, Redis doesn't require a password. If you're using a password, configure it variable. |\n| `queue.bull.redis.db:0` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_DB` | The default value is `0`. If you change this value, update the configuration. |\n| `queue.bull.redis.timeoutThreshold:10000ms` | `QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_TIMEOUT_THRESHOLD` | Tells n8n how long it should wait if Redis is unavailable before exiting. The default value is `10000` (ms). |\n| `queue.bull.gracefulShutdownTimeout:30` | `N8N_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | A graceful shutdown timeout for workers to finish executing jobs before terminating the process. The default value is `30` seconds. |\n\nNow you can start your n8n instance and it will connect to your Redis instance.\n\n### Start workers[#](#start-workers \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou will need to start worker processes to allow n8n to execute workflows. If you want to host workers on a separate machine, install n8n on the machine and make sure that it's connected to your Redis instance and the n8n database.\n\nStart worker processes by running the following command from the root directory:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `./packages/cli/bin/n8n worker` |\n\nIf you're using Docker, use the following command:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `docker run --name n8n-queue -p 5679:5678 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n worker` |\n\nYou can set up multiple worker processes. Make sure that all the worker processes have access to Redis and the n8n database.\n\n#### Worker server[#](#worker-server \"Permanent link\")\n\nEach worker process runs a server that exposes optional endpoints:\n\n*   `/healthz`: returns whether the worker is up, if you enable the `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE` environment variable\n*   `/healthz/readiness`: returns whether worker's DB and Redis connections are ready, if you enable the `QUEUE_HEALTH_CHECK_ACTIVE` environment variable\n*   [credentials overwrite endpoint](https://docs.n8n.io/embed/configuration/#credential-overwrites)\n*   [`/metrics`](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/prometheus/)\n\n#### View running workers[#](#view-running-workers \"Permanent link\")\n\nFeature availability\n\n*   Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans.\n*   If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa).\n\nYou can view running workers and their performance metrics in n8n by selecting **Settings** > **Workers**.\n\n## Running n8n with queues[#](#running-n8n-with-queues \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen running n8n with queues, all the production workflow executions get processed by worker processes. This means that even the webhook calls get delegated to the worker processes, which might add some overhead and extra latency.\n\nRedis acts as the message broker, and the database persists data, so access to both is required. Running a distributed system with this setup over SQLite isn't supported.\n\nMigrate data\n\nIf you want to migrate data from one database to another, you can use the Export and Import commands. Refer to the [CLI commands for n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/cli-commands/#export-workflows-and-credentials) documentation to learn how to use these commands.\n\n## Webhook processors[#](#webhook-processors \"Permanent link\")\n\nKeep in mind\n\nWebhook processes rely on Redis too. Follow the [configure the workers](#configuring-workers) section above to setup webhook processor nodes.\n\nWebhook processors are another layer of scaling in n8n. Configuring the webhook processor is optional, and allows you to scale the incoming webhook requests.\n\nThis method allows n8n to process a huge number of parallel requests. All you have to do is add more webhook processes and workers accordingly. The webhook process will listen to requests on the same port (default: `5678`). Run these processes in containers or separate machines, and have a load balancing system to route requests accordingly.\n\nn8n doesn't recommend adding the main process to the load balancer pool. If you add the main process to the pool, it will receive requests and possibly a heavy load. This will result in degraded performance for editing, viewing, and interacting with the n8n UI.\n\nYou can start the webhook processor by executing the following command from the root directory:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `./packages/cli/bin/n8n webhook` |\n\nIf you're using Docker, use the following command:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `docker run --name n8n-queue -p 5679:5678 docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n webhook` |\n\n### Configure webhook URL[#](#configure-webhook-url \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo configure your webhook URL, execute the following command on the machine running the main n8n instance:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `export WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-webhook-url.com` |\n\nYou can also set this value in the configuration file.\n\n### Configure load balancer[#](#configure-load-balancer \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen using multiple webhook processes you will need a load balancer to route requests. If you are using the same domain name for your n8n instance and the webhooks, you can set up your load balancer to route requests as follows:\n\n*   Redirect any request that matches `/webhook/*` to the webhook servers pool\n*   All other paths (the n8n internal API, the static files for the editor, etc.) should get routed to the main process\n\n**Note:** The default URL for manual workflow executions is `/webhook-test/*`. Make sure that these URLs route to your main process.\n\nYou can change this path in the configuration file `endpoints.webhook` or using the `N8N_ENDPOINT_WEBHOOK` environment variable. If you change these, update your load balancer accordingly.\n\n### Disable webhook processing in the main process (optional)[#](#disable-webhook-processing-in-the-main-process-optional \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou have webhook processors to execute the workflows. You can disable the webhook processing in the main process. This will make sure to execute all webhook executions in the webhook processors. In the configuration file set `endpoints.disableProductionWebhooksOnMainProcess` to `true` so that n8n doesn't process webhook requests on the main process.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the following command:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `export N8N_DISABLE_PRODUCTION_MAIN_PROCESS=true` |\n\nWhen disabling the webhook process in the main process, run the main process and don't add it to the load balancer's webhook pool.\n\n## Configure worker concurrency[#](#configure-worker-concurrency \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can define the number of jobs a worker can run in parallel by using the `concurrency` flag. It defaults to `10`. To change it:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `n8n worker --concurrency=5` |\n\n## Concurrency and scaling recommendations[#](#concurrency-and-scaling-recommendations \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n recommends setting concurrency to 5 or higher for your worker instances. Setting low concurrency values with a large numbers of workers can exhaust your database's connection pool, leading to processing delays and failures.\n\n## Multi-main setup[#](#multi-main-setup \"Permanent link\")\n\nFeature availability\n\n*   Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans.\n*   If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa).\n\nIn queue mode you can run more than one `main` process for high availability.\n\nIn a single-mode setup, the `main` process does two sets of tasks:\n\n*   **regular tasks**, such as running the API, serving the UI, and listening for webhooks, and\n*   **at-most-once tasks**, such as running non-HTTP triggers (timers, pollers, and persistent connections like RabbitMQ and IMAP), and pruning executions and binary data.\n\nIn a multi-main setup, there are two kinds of `main` processes:\n\n*   **followers**, which run **regular tasks**, and\n*   the **leader**, which runs **both regular and at-most-once tasks**.\n\n### Leader designation[#](#leader-designation \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn a multi-main setup, all main instances handle the leadership process transparently to users. In case the current leader becomes unavailable, for example because it crashed or its event loop became too busy, other followers can take over. If the previous leader becomes responsive again, it becomes a follower.\n\n### Configuring multi-main setup[#](#configuring-multi-main-setup \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo deploy n8n in multi-main setup, ensure:\n\n*   All `main` processes are running in queue mode and are connected to Postgres and Redis.\n*   All `main` and `worker` processes are running the same version of n8n.\n*   All `main` processes have set the environment variable `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_ENABLED` to `true`.\n*   All `main` processes are running behind a load balancer with session persistence (sticky sessions) enabled.\n\nIf needed, you can adjust the leader key options:\n\n| Using configuration file | Using environment variables | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `multiMainSetup.ttl:10` | `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_KEY_TTL=10` | Time to live (in seconds) for leader key in multi-main setup. |\n| `multiMainSetup.interval:3` | `N8N_MULTI_MAIN_SETUP_CHECK_INTERVAL=3` | Interval (in seconds) for leader check in multi-main setup. |\n\nKeep in mind\n\nIn multi-main setup, all `main` processes listen for webhooks, so they fulfill the same purpose as `webhook` processes. Running `webhook` processes is neither needed nor allowed in multi-main setup."

A common pattern is to use a Set node before the node that sends data, to convert the data to match the schema of the service you're connecting to. The resource mapper UI component provides a way to get data into the required format directly within the node, rather than using a Set node. The resource mapper component can also validate input data against the schema provided in the node, and cast input data into the expected type.\n\nMapping and matching\n\nMapping is the process of setting the input data to use as values when updating row(s). Matching is the process of using column names to identify the row(s) to update.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29<br>30<br>31<br>32 | `{ \tdisplayName: 'Columns', \tname: 'columns', // The name used to reference the element UI within the code \ttype: 'resourceMapper', // The UI element type \tdefault: { \t\t// mappingMode can be defined in the component (mappingMode: 'defineBelow') \t\t// or you can attempt automatic mapping (mappingMode: 'autoMapInputData') \t\tmappingMode: 'defineBelow', \t\t// Important: always set default value to null \t\tvalue: null, \t}, \trequired: true, \t// See \"Resource mapper type options interface\" below for the full typeOptions specification \ttypeOptions: { \t\tresourceMapper: { \t\t\tresourceMapperMethod: 'getMappingColumns', \t\t\tmode: 'update', \t\t\tfieldWords: { \t\t\t\tsingular: 'column', \t\t\t\tplural: 'columns', \t\t\t}, \t\t\taddAllFields: true,  \t\t\tmultiKeyMatch: true, \t\t\tsupportAutoMap: true, \t\t\tmatchingFieldsLabels: { \t\t\t\ttitle: 'Custom matching columns title', \t\t\t\tdescription: 'Help text for custom matching columns', \t\t\t\thint: 'Below-field hint for custom matching columns', \t\t\t}, \t\t}, \t}, },` |\n\nRefer to the [Postgres node (version 2)](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Postgres/v2) for a live example using a database schema.\n\nRefer to the [Google Sheets node (version 2)](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Google/Sheet/v2) for a live example using a schema-less service.\n\n### Resource mapper type options interface[#](#resource-mapper-type-options-interface \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe `typeOptions` section must implement the following interface:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29<br>30 | `export interface ResourceMapperTypeOptions { \t// The name of the method where you fetch the schema \t// Refer to the Resource mapper method section for more detail \tresourceMapperMethod: string; \t// Choose the mode for your operation \t// Supported modes: add, update, upsert \tmode: 'add' \\| 'update' \\| 'upsert'; \t// Specify labels for fields in the UI \tfieldWords?: { singular: string; plural: string }; \t// Whether n8n should display a UI input for every field when node first added to workflow \t// Default is true \taddAllFields?: boolean; \t// Specify a message to show if no fields are fetched from the service  \t// (the call is successful but the response is empty) \tnoFieldsError?: string; \t// Whether to support multi-key column matching \t// multiKeyMatch is for update and upsert only \t// Default is false \t// If true, the node displays a multi-select dropdown for the matching column selector \tmultiKeyMatch?: boolean; \t// Whether to support automatic mapping \t// If false, n8n hides the mapping mode selector field and sets mappingMode to defineBelow \tsupportAutoMap?: boolean; \t// Custom labels for the matching columns selector \tmatchingFieldsLabels?: { \t\ttitle?: string; \t\tdescription?: string; \t\thint?: string; \t}; }` |\n\n### Resource mapper method[#](#resource-mapper-method \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis method contains your node-specific logic for fetching the data schema.

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. n8n requires Node.js 18 or above.\n\nLatest and Next versions\n\nn8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).\n\nCurrent `latest`: 1.75.2  \nCurrent `next`: 1.76.1\n\n## Try n8n with npx[#](#try-n8n-with-npx \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can try n8n without installing it using npx.\n\nFrom the terminal, run:\n\nThis command will download everything that's needed to start n8n. You can then access n8n and start building workflows by opening [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678/).\n\n## Install globally with npm[#](#install-globally-with-npm \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo install n8n globally, use npm:\n\nTo install or update to a specific version of n8n use the `@` syntax to specify the version. For example:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `npm install -g n8n@0.126.1` |\n\nTo install `next`:\n\nAfter the installation, start n8n by running:\n\nKeep in mind\n\nWindows users remember to change into the `.n8n` directory of your Home folder (`~/.n8n`) before running `n8n start`.\n\n### Next steps[#](#next-steps \"Permanent link\")\n\nTry out n8n using the [Quickstarts](https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/).\n\n## Updating[#](#updating \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo update your n8n instance to the `latest` version, run:\n\nTo install the `next` version:\n\n## n8n with tunnel[#](#n8n-with-tunnel \"Permanent link\")\n\nDanger\n\nUse this for local development and testing.

This document provides guidance on good code practices for node building. It focuses on code details. For UI standards and UX guidance, refer to [Node UI design](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/node-ui-design/).\n\n## Use the linter[#](#use-the-linter \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe n8n node linter provides automatic checking for many of the node-building standards. You should ensure your node passes the linter's checks before publishing it. Refer to the [n8n node linter](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/test/node-linter/) documentation for more information.\n\n## Use the starter[#](#use-the-starter \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe n8n node starter project includes a recommended setup, dependencies (including the linter), and examples to help you get started. Begin new projects with the [starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter).\n\n## Write in TypeScript[#](#write-in-typescript \"Permanent link\")\n\nAll n8n code is TypeScript.

If your node can do these operations on more than one resource, create a `Resource` parameter. The following code sample shows a basic resource and operations setup:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29<br>30<br>31<br>32<br>33<br>34<br>35<br>36<br>37<br>38<br>39<br>40<br>41<br>42<br>43<br>44 | `export const ExampleNode implements INodeType {     description: {         displayName: 'Example Node',         ...         properties: [             {                 displayName: 'Resource',                 name: 'resource',                 type: 'options',                 options: [                     {                         name: 'Resource One',                         value: 'resourceOne'                     },                     {                         name: 'Resource Two',                         value: 'resourceTwo'                     }                 ],                 default: 'resourceOne'             },             {                 displayName: 'Operation',                 name: 'operation',                 type: 'options',                 // Only show these operations for Resource One                 displayOptions: {                     show: {                         resource: [                             'resourceOne'                         ]                     }                 },                 options: [                     {                         name: 'Create',                         value: 'create',                         description: 'Create an instance of Resource One'                     }                 ]             }         ]     } }` |\n\n### Reuse internal parameter names[#](#reuse-internal-parameter-names \"Permanent link\")\n\nAll resource and operation fields in an n8n node have two settings: a display name, set using the `name` parameter, and an internal name, set using the `value` parameter. Reusing the internal name for fields allows n8n to preserve user-entered data if a user switches operations.\n\nFor example: you're building a node with a resource named 'Order'. This resource has several operations, including Get, Edit, and Delete. Each of these operations uses an order ID to perform the operation on the specified order. You need to display an ID field for the user. This field has a display label, and an internal name. By using the same internal name (set in `value`) for the operation ID field on each resource, a user can enter the ID with the Get operation selected, and not lose it if they switch to Edit.\n\nWhen reusing the internal name, you must ensure that only one field is visible to the user at a time. You can control this using `displayOptions`.\n\n## Detailed guidelines for writing a programmatic-style node[#](#detailed-guidelines-for-writing-a-programmatic-style-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nThese guidelines apply when building nodes using the programmatic node-building style. They aren't relevant when using the declarative style. For more information on different node-building styles, refer to [Choose your node building approach](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/).\n\n### Don't change incoming data[#](#dont-change-incoming-data \"Permanent link\")\n\nNever change the incoming data a node receives (data accessible with `this.getInputData()`) as all nodes share it. If you need to add, change, or delete data, clone the incoming data and return the new data. If you don't do this, sibling nodes that execute after the current one will operate on the altered data and process incorrect data.\n\nIt's not necessary to always clone all the data. For example, if a node changes the binary data but not the JSON data, you can create a new item that reuses the reference to the JSON item.\n\n### Use the built in request library[#](#use-the-built-in-request-library \"Permanent link\")\n\nSome third-party services have their own libraries on npm, which make it easier to create an integration. The problem with these packages is that you add another dependency (plus all the dependencies of the dependencies). This adds more and more code, which has to be loaded, can introduce security vulnerabilities, bugs, and so on. Instead, use the built-in module:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `// If no auth needed const response = await this.helpers.httpRequest(options);  // If auth needed const response = await this.helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication.call( \tthis,  \t'credentialTypeName', // For example: pipedriveApi \toptions, );` |\n\nThis uses the npm package [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).\n\nRefer to [HTTP helpers](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/http-helpers/) for more information, and for migration instructions for the removed `this.helpers.request`."

Read [Cloud concurrency](https://docs.n8n.io/manage-cloud/concurrency/) to learn how concurrency works with n8n Cloud accounts.\n\nIn regular mode, n8n doesn't limit how many production executions may run at the same time. This can lead to a scenario where too many concurrent executions thrash the event loop, causing performance degradation and unresponsiveness.\n\nTo prevent this, you can set a concurrency limit for production executions in regular mode. Use this to control how many production executions run concurrently, and queue up any concurrent production executions over the limit. These executions remain in the queue until concurrency capacity frees up, and are then processed in FIFO order.\n\nConcurrency control is disabled by default. To enable it:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `export N8N_CONCURRENCY_PRODUCTION_LIMIT=20` |\n\nKeep in mind:\n\n*   Concurrency control applies only to production executions: those started from a webhook or trigger node. It doesn't apply to any other kinds, such as manual executions, sub-workflow executions, error executions, or started from CLI.\n*   You can't retry queued executions. Cancelling or deleting a queued execution also removes it from the queue.\n*   On instance startup, n8n resumes queued executions up to the concurrency limit and re-enqueues the rest.\n\n*   To monitor concurrency control, watch logs for executions being added to the queue and released. In a future version, n8n will show concurrency control in the UI.\n\nWhen you enable concurrency control, you can view the number of active executions and the configured limit at the top of a project's or workflow's executions tab.\n\n## Comparison to queue mode[#](#comparison-to-queue-mode \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn queue mode, you can control how many jobs a worker may run concurrently using the [`--concurrency` flag](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/queue-mode/#configure-worker-concurrency).\n\nConcurrency control in queue mode is a separate mechanism from concurrency control in regular mode, but the environment variable `N8N_CONCURRENCY_PRODUCTION_LIMIT` controls both of them. In queue mode, n8n takes the limit from this variable if set to a value other than `-1`, falling back to the `--concurrency` flag or its default."

  "markdown": "# Docker | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/installation/docker.md \"Edit this page\")\n\n## Docker Installation[#](#docker-installation \"Permanent link\")\n\n[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) offers the following advantages:\n\n*   Install n8n in a clean environment.\n*   Easier setup for your preferred database.\n*   Can avoid issues due to different operating systems, as Docker provides a consistent system.\n\nYou can also use n8n in Docker with [Docker Compose](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/server-setups/docker-compose/). You can find Docker Compose configurations for various architectures in the [n8n-hosting repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting).\n\n## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites \"Permanent link\")\n\nBefore proceeding, install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).\n\nLinux Users\n\nDocker Desktop is available for Mac and Windows. Linux users must install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) individually for your distribution.\n\nSelf-hosting knowledge prerequisites\n\nSelf-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:\n\n*   Setting up and configuring servers and containers\n*   Managing application resources and scaling\n*   Securing servers and applications\n*   Configuring n8n\n\nn8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).\n\nLatest and Next versions\n\nn8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).\n\nCurrent `latest`: 1.75.2  \nCurrent `next`: 1.76.1\n\n## Starting n8n[#](#starting-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nFrom your terminal, run:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `docker volume create n8n_data  docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n` |\n\nThis command will download all required n8n images and start your container, exposed on port `5678`. To save your work between container restarts, it also mounts a docker volume, `n8n_data`, to persist your data locally.\n\nYou can then access n8n by opening: [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678/)\n\n## Using alternate databases[#](#using-alternate-databases \"Permanent link\")\n\nBy default n8n uses SQLite to save credentials, past executions and workflows. n8n also supports PostgresDB configurable using environment variables as detailed below.\n\nIt's important to still persist data in the `/home/node/.n8n` folder as it contains n8n user data and even more importantly the encryption key for credentials. It's also the name of the webhook when the n8n tunnel is used.\n\nIf no directory is found, n8n creates automatically one on startup. In this case, existing credentials saved with a different encryption key can not be used anymore.\n\nKeep in mind\n\nPersisting the `/home/node/.n8n` directory even when using alternate databases is the recommended best practice, but not explicitly required. The encryption key can be provided using the `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` [environment variable](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/).\n\n### PostgresDB[#](#postgresdb \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo use n8n with Postgres, provide the corresponding:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14 | `docker volume create n8n_data  docker run -it --rm \\  --name n8n \\  -p 5678:5678 \\  -e DB_TYPE=postgresdb \\  -e DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=<POSTGRES_DATABASE> \\  -e DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=<POSTGRES_HOST> \\  -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=<POSTGRES_PORT> \\  -e DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=<POSTGRES_USER> \\  -e DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA=<POSTGRES_SCHEMA> \\  -e DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=<POSTGRES_PASSWORD> \\  -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \\  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n` |\n\nA complete `docker-compose` file for Postgres can be found [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-hosting/tree/main/docker-compose/withPostgres).\n\n## Setting timezone[#](#setting-timezone \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo define the timezone n8n should use, the environment variable `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` can be set. This gets used by schedule based nodes such as the Cron node.\n\nThe timezone of the system can also be set separately. This controls what some scripts and commands return like `$ date`. The system timezone can be set using the environment variable `TZ`.\n\nExample using the same timezone for both:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `docker volume create n8n_data  docker run -it --rm \\  --name n8n \\  -p 5678:5678 \\  -e GENERIC_TIMEZONE=\"Europe/Berlin\" \\  -e TZ=\"Europe/Berlin\" \\  -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \\  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n` |\n\n## Updating[#](#updating \"Permanent link\")\n\nFrom your Docker Desktop, navigate to the **Images** tab and select **Pull** from the context menu to download the latest n8n image:\n\n![Docker Desktop](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/hosting/installation/docker/docker_desktop.png)\n\nYou can also use the command line to pull the latest, or a specific version:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `# Pull latest (stable) version docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n  # Pull specific version docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:0.220.1  # Pull next (unstable) version docker pull docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:next` |\n\nStop the container and start it again. You can also use the command line:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `# Get the container ID docker ps -a  # Stop the container with ID container_id docker stop [container_id]  # Remove the container with ID container_id docker rm [container_id]  # Start the container docker run --name=[container_name] [options] -d docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n` |\n\n### Docker Compose[#](#docker-compose \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you run n8n using a Docker Compose file, follow these steps to update n8n:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `# Pull latest version docker compose pull  # Stop and remove older version docker compose down  # Start the container docker compose up -d` |\n\n## Further reading[#](#further-reading \"Permanent link\")\n\nMore information about Docker setup can be found in the README file of the [Docker Image](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/docker/images/n8n).\n\n## n8n with tunnel[#](#n8n-with-tunnel \"Permanent link\")\n\nDanger\n\nUse this for local development and testing. It isn't safe to use it in production.\n\nTo be able to use webhooks for trigger nodes of external services like GitHub, n8n has to be reachable from the web. n8n has a [tunnel service](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) which redirects requests from n8n's servers to your local n8n instance.\n\nStart n8n with `--tunnel` by running:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `docker volume create n8n_data  docker run -it --rm \\  --name n8n \\  -p 5678:5678 \\  -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n \\  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n \\  start --tunnel` |\n\n## Next steps[#](#next-steps \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   Learn more about [configuring](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/overview) n8n.\n*   Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/)."

All nodes must have a base file. The contents of this file are different depending on whether you're building a declarative-style or programmatic-style node. For guidance on which style to use, refer to [Choose your node building approach](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/).\n\nThese documents give short code snippets to help understand the code structure and concepts. For full walk-throughs of building a node, including real-world code examples, refer to [Build a declarative-style node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/) or [Build a programmatic-style node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/programmatic-style-node/).\n\nYou can also explore the [n8n-nodes-starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter) and n8n's own [nodes](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes) for a wider range of examples. The starter contains basic examples that you can build on. The n8n [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost) is a good example of a more complex programmatic-style node, including versioning.\n\nFor all nodes, refer to the:\n\n*   [Structure of the node base file](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/structure/)\n*   [Standard parameters](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/standard-parameters/)\n\nFor declarative-style nodes, refer to the:\n\n*   [Declarative-style parameters](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/declarative-style-parameters/)\n\nFor programmatic-style nodes, refer to the:\n\n*   [Programmatic-style parameters](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/programmatic-style-parameters/)\n*   [Programmatic-style execute() method](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/node-base-files/programmatic-style-execute-method/)"

You can make changes to existing nodes without breaking the existing behavior by introducing a new version.\n\nBe aware of how n8n decides which node version to load:\n\n*   If a user builds and saves a workflow using version 1, n8n continues to use version 1 in that workflow, even if you create and publish a version 2 of the node.\n*   When a user creates a new workflow and browses for nodes, n8n always loads the latest version of the node.\n\nVersioning type restricted by node style\n\nIf you build a node using the declarative style, you can't use full versioning.\n\n## Light versioning[#](#light-versioning \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis is available for all node types.\n\nOne node can contain more than one version, allowing small version increments without code duplication. To use this feature:\n\n1.  Change the main `version` parameter to an array, and add your version numbers, including your existing version.\n2.  You can then access the version parameter with `@version` in your `displayOptions` in any object (to control which versions n8n displays the object with). You can also query the version from a function using `const nodeVersion = this.getNode().typeVersion;`.\n\nAs an example, say you want to add versioning to the NasaPics node from the [Declarative node tutorial](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/declarative-style-node/), then configure a resource so that n8n only displays it in version 2 of the node. In your base `NasaPics.node.ts` file:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20 | `{     displayName: 'NASA Pics',     name: 'NasaPics',     icon: 'file:nasapics.svg',     // List the available versions     version: [1,2,3],     // More basic parameters here     properties: [         // Add a resource that's only displayed for version2         {             displayName: 'Resource name',             // More resource parameters             displayOptions: {                 show: {                     '@version': 2,                 },             },         },     ], }` |\n\n## Full versioning[#](#full-versioning \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis isn't available for declarative-style nodes.\n\nAs an example, refer to the [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost).\n\nFull versioning summary:\n\n*   The base node file should extend `NodeVersionedType` instead of `INodeType`.\n*   The base node file should contain a description including the `defaultVersion` (usually the latest), other basic node metadata such as name, and a list of versions. It shouldn't contain any node functionality.\n*   n8n recommends using `v1`, `v2`, and so on, for version folder names."

If you don't set `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE`, 336 hours (14 days) is the default.\n\nYou can choose to prune finished executions data before the time set in `EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE`, using `EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT`. This sets a maximum number of executions to store in the database. Once you reach the limit, n8n starts to delete the oldest execution records. This can help with database performance issues, especially if you use SQLite. The database size can still exceed the limit you set: old executions that haven't finished running don't get deleted, even if they would otherwise be subject to deletion.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `# npm # Activate automatic data pruning export EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true  # Number of hours after execution that n8n deletes data export EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=168  # Number of executions to store export EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT=50000` |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `# Docker docker run -it --rm \\  --name n8n \\  -p 5678:5678 \\  -e EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true \\  -e EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=168 \\  docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n` |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `# Docker Compose n8n:     environment:       - EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE=true       - EXECUTIONS_DATA_MAX_AGE=168 \t  \t- EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT=50000` |\n\nSQLite\n\nIf you run n8n using the default SQLite database, the disk space of any pruned data isn't automatically freed up but rather reused for future executions data. To free up this space configure the `DB_SQLITE_VACUUM_ON_STARTUP` [environment variable](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/database/#sqlite) or manually run the [VACUUM](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html) operation.\n\nBinary data pruning\n\nBinary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. This may change in future."

It uses:\n\n*   [Caddy](http://caddyserver.com/) (a reverse proxy) to allow access to the Droplet from the internet. Caddy will also automatically create and manage SSL / TLS certificates for your n8n instance.\n*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to create and define the application components and how they work together.\n\nSelf-hosting knowledge prerequisites\n\nSelf-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:\n\n*   Setting up and configuring servers and containers\n*   Managing application resources and scaling\n*   Securing servers and applications\n*   Configuring n8n\n\nn8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).\n\nLatest and Next versions\n\nn8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).\n\nCurrent `latest`: 1.75.2  \nCurrent `next`: 1.76.1\n\n## Create a Droplet[#](#create-a-droplet \"Permanent link\")\n\n1.  [Log in](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/login) to DigitalOcean.\n2.  Select the project to host the Droplet, or [create a new project](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/projects/how-to/create/).\n3.  In your project, select **Droplets** from the **Manage** menu.\n4.  [Create a new Droplet](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/create/) using the [Docker image](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/docker) available on the **Marketplace** tab.\n\nDroplet resources\n\nWhen creating the Droplet, DigitalOcean asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, a basic shared CPU plan is enough.\n\nSSH key or Password\n\nDigitalOcean lets you choose between SSH key and password-based authentication. SSH keys are considered more secure.\n\n## Log in to your Droplet and create new user[#](#log-in-to-your-droplet-and-create-new-user \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe rest of this guide requires you to log in to the Droplet using a terminal with SSH. Refer to [How to Connect to Droplets with SSH](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/) for more information.\n\nYou should create a new user, to avoid working as the root user:\n\n1.  Log in as root.\n2.  Create a new user:\n3.  Follow the prompts in the CLI to finish creating the user.\n4.  Grant the new user administrative privileges:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `usermod -aG sudo <username>` |\n    \n    You can now run commands with superuser privileges by using `sudo` before the command.\n5.  Follow the steps to set up SSH for the new user: [Add Public Key Authentication](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04#step-four-add-public-key-authentication-recommended).\n6.  Log out of the droplet.\n7.  Log in using SSH as the new user.\n\n## Clone configuration repository[#](#clone-configuration-repository \"Permanent link\")\n\nDocker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy) into the home folder of the logged-in user on your Droplet. The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make.\n\nClone the repository with the following command:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy.git` |\n\nAnd change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:\n\n## Default folders and files[#](#default-folders-and-files \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe host operating system (the DigitalOcean Droplet) copies the two folders you created to Docker containers to make them available to Docker. The two folders are:\n\n*   `caddy_config`: Holds the Caddy configuration files.\n*   `local_files`: A folder for files you upload or add using n8n.\n\n### Create Docker volumes[#](#create-docker-volumes \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo persist the Caddy cache between restarts and speed up start times, create [a Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) that Docker reuses between restarts:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `sudo docker volume create caddy_data` |\n\nCreate a Docker volume for the n8n data:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `sudo docker volume create n8n_data` |\n\n## Set up DNS[#](#set-up-dns \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the Droplet. The exact steps for this depend on your DNS provider, but typically you need to create a new \"A\" record for the n8n subdomain. DigitalOcean provide [An Introduction to DNS Terminology, Components, and Concepts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-dns-terminology-components-and-concepts).\n\n## Open ports[#](#open-ports \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n runs as a web application, so the Droplet needs to allow incoming access to traffic on port 80 for non-secure traffic, and port 443 for secure traffic.\n\nOpen the following ports in the Droplet's firewall by running the following two commands:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `sudo ufw allow 80 sudo ufw allow 443` |\n\n## Configure n8n[#](#configure-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the Docker container. The example `.env` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own.\n\nOpen the file with the following command:\n\nThe file contains inline comments to help you know what to change.\n\nRefer to [Environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.\n\n## The Docker Compose file[#](#the-docker-compose-file \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) defines the services the application needs, in this case Caddy and n8n.\n\n*   The Caddy service definition defines the ports it uses and the local volumes to copy to the containers.\n*   The n8n service definition defines the ports it uses, the environment variables n8n needs to run (some defined in the `.env` file), and the volumes it needs to copy to the containers.\n\nThe Docker Compose file uses the environment variables set in the `.env` file, so you shouldn't need to change it's content, but to take a look, run the following command:\n\n## Configure Caddy[#](#configure-caddy \"Permanent link\")\n\nCaddy needs to know which domains it should serve, and which port to expose to the outside world. Edit the `Caddyfile` file in the `caddy_config` folder.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `nano caddy_config/Caddyfile` |\n\nChange the placeholder domain to yours. If you followed the steps to name the subdomain n8n, your full domain is similar to `n8n.example.com`. The `n8n` in the `reverse_proxy` setting tells Caddy to use the service definition defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `n8n.<domain>.<suffix> {     reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {       flush_interval -1     } }` |\n\nIf you were to use `automate.example.com`, your `Caddyfile` may look something like:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `automate.example.com {     reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {       flush_interval -1     } }` |\n\n## Start Docker Compose[#](#start-docker-compose \"Permanent link\")\n\nStart n8n and Caddy with the following command:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `sudo docker compose up -d` |\n\nThis may take a few minutes.\n\n## Test your setup[#](#test-your-setup \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn your browser, open the URL formed of the subdomain and domain name defined earlier. Enter the user name and password defined earlier, and you should be able to access n8n.\n\n## Stop n8n and Caddy[#](#stop-n8n-and-caddy \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can stop n8n and Caddy with the following command:\n\n## Updating[#](#updating \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you run n8n using a Docker Compose file, follow these steps to update n8n:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `# Pull latest version docker compose pull  # Stop and remove older version docker compose down  # Start the container docker compose up -d` |\n\n## Next steps[#](#next-steps \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   Learn more about [configuring](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/overview) n8n.\n*   Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/)."

This can cause crashes when working with large files.\n\nTo avoid this, change the `N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE` [environment variable](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/binary-data) to `filesystem`. This causes n8n to save data to disk, instead of using memory.\n\nIf you're using queue mode, keep this to `default`. n8n doesn't support filesystem mode with queue mode.\n\n## Binary data pruning[#](#binary-data-pruning \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n executes binary data pruning as part of execution data pruning. Refer to [Execution data | Enable data pruning](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/execution-data/#enable-data-pruning) for details.\n\nIf you configure multiple binary data modes, binary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem.

Add import statements.\n2.  Create a class for the node.\n3.  Within the node class, create a `description` object, which defines the node.\n\nA programmatic-style node also has an `execute()` method, which reads incoming data and parameters, then builds a request.

Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).\n\nLatest and Next versions\n\nn8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).\n\nCurrent `latest`: 1.75.2  \nCurrent `next`: 1.76.1\n\n## Use the deployment template to create a Heroku project[#](#use-the-deployment-template-to-create-a-heroku-project \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe quickest way to get started with deploying n8n to Heroku is using the **Deploy to Heroku** button:\n\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new?template=https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-heroku/tree/main)\n\nThis opens the **Create New App** page on Heroku. Set a name for the project, and choose the region to deploy the project to.\n\n### Configure environment variables[#](#configure-environment-variables \"Permanent link\")\n\nHeroku pre-fills the configuration options defined in the `env` section of the `app.json` file, which also sets default values for the environment variables n8n uses.\n\nYou can change any of these values to suit your needs. You must change the following values:\n\n*   **N8N\\_ENCRYPTION\\_KEY**, which n8n uses to [encrypt user account details](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) before saving to the database.\n*   **WEBHOOK\\_URL** should match the application name you create to ensure that webhooks have the correct URL.\n\n### Deploy n8n[#](#deploy-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nSelect **Deploy app**.\n\nAfter Heroku builds and deploys the app it provides links to **Manage App** or **View** the application.\n\nHeroku and DNS\n\nRefer to the [Heroku documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/networking-dns) to find out how to connect your domain to a Heroku application.\n\n## Changing the deployment template[#](#changing-the-deployment-template \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can make changes to the deployment template by forking the [repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-heroku) and deploying from you fork.\n\n### The Dockerfile[#](#the-dockerfile \"Permanent link\")\n\nBy default the Dockerfile pulls the latest n8n image, if you want to use a different or fixed version, then update the image tag on the top line of the `Dockerfile`.\n\n### Heroku and exposing ports[#](#heroku-and-exposing-ports \"Permanent link\")\n\nHeroku doesn't allow Docker-based applications to define an exposed port with the `EXPOSE` command. Instead, Heroku provides a `PORT` environment variable that it dynamically populates at application runtime. The `entrypoint.sh` file overrides the default Docker image command to instead set the port variable that Heroku provides. You can then access n8n on port 80 in a web browser.\n\nDocker limitations with Heroku\n\n[Read this guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime#unsupported-dockerfile-commands) for more details on the limitations of using Docker with Heroku.\n\n### Configuring Heroku[#](#configuring-heroku \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe `heroku.yml` file defines the application you want to create on Heroku. It consists of two sections:\n\n*   `setup` > `addons` defines the Heroku addons to use. In this case, the PostgreSQL database addon.\n*   The `build` section defines how Heroku builds the application. In this case it uses the Docker buildpack to build a `web` service based on the supplied `Dockerfile`.\n\n## Next steps[#](#next-steps \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   Learn more about [configuring](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/overview) n8n.\n*   Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/)."

If the icon works in both light and dark modes, use a string that starts with `file:`, indicating the path to the icon file. For example:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `icon: 'file:exampleNodeIcon.svg'` |\n\nTo provide different icons for light and dark modes, use an object with `light` and `dark` properties.

If using PNG, the icon resolution should be 60x60px. Node icons should have a square or near-square aspect ratio.\n\nDon't reference Font Awesome\n\nIf you want to use a Font Awesome icon in your node, download and embed the image.\n\n## `group`[#](#group \"Permanent link\")\n\n_Array of strings_ | _Required_\n\nTells n8n how the node behaves when the workflow runs.

The default is `false` (requiring only one input branch to run).\n\n## `inputs`[#](#inputs \"Permanent link\")\n\n_Array of strings_ | _Required_\n\nNames the input connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the input side. If you need only one connector, use `input: ['main']`.\n\n## `outputs`[#](#outputs \"Permanent link\")\n\n_Array of strings_ | _Required_\n\nNames the output connectors. Controls the number of connectors the node has on the output side. If you need only one connector, use `output: ['main']`.\n\n## `requiredInputs`[#](#requiredinputs \"Permanent link\")\n\n_Integer_ or _Array_ | _Optional_\n\nUsed for multi-input nodes. Specify inputs by number that must have data (their branches must run) before the node can execute.\n\n## `credentials`[#](#credentials \"Permanent link\")\n\n_Array of objects_ | _Required_\n\nThis parameter tells n8n the credential options. Each object defines an authentication type.\n\nThe object must include:\n\n*   `name`: the credential name. Must match the `name` property in the credential file. For example, `name: 'asanaApi'` in [`Asana.node.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Asana/Asana.node.ts) links to `name = 'asanaApi'` in [`AsanaApi.credential.ts`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/credentials/AsanaApi.credentials.ts).\n*   `required`: Boolean. Specify whether authentication is required to use this node.\n\n## `requestDefaults`[#](#requestdefaults \"Permanent link\")\n\n_Object_ | _Required_\n\nSet up the basic information for the API calls the node makes.\n\nThis object must include:\n\n*   `baseURL`: The API base URL.\n\nYou can also add:\n\n*   `headers`: an object describing the API call headers, such as content type.\n*   `url`: string. Appended to the `baseURL`. You can usually leave this out. It's more common to provide this in the `operations`.\n\n## `properties`[#](#properties \"Permanent link\")\n\n_Array of objects_ | _Required_\n\nThis contains the resource and operations objects that define node behaviors, as well as objects to set up mandatory and optional fields that can receive user input.\n\n### Resource objects[#](#resource-objects \"Permanent link\")\n\nA resource object includes the following parameters:\n\n*   `displayName`: String. This should always be `Resource`.\n*   `name`: String. This should always be `resource`.\n*   `type`: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, `options` results in n8n adding a dropdown that allows users to choose one option. Refer to [Node UI elements](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/) for more information.\n*   `noDataExpression`: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be `true` for `resource`.\n\n### Operations objects[#](#operations-objects \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe operations object defines the available operations on a resource.\n\n*   `displayName`: String. This should always be `Options`.\n*   `name`: String. This should always be `option`.\n*   `type`: String. Tells n8n which UI element to use, and what input type to expect. For example, `dateTime` results in n8n adding a date picker. Refer to [Node UI elements](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/) for more information.\n*   `noDataExpression`: Boolean. Prevents using an expression for the parameter. Must always be `true` for `operation`.\n*   `options`: Array of objects. Each objects describes an operation's behavior, such as its routing, the REST verb it uses, and so on. An `options` object includes:\n    *   `name`. String.\n    *   `value`. String.\n    *   `action`: String. This parameter combines the resource and operation. You should always include it, as n8n will use it in future versions. For example, given a resource called `\"Card\"` and an operation `\"Get all\"`, your action is `\"Get all cards\"`.\n    *   `description`: String.\n    *   `routing`: Object containing request details.\n\n### Additional fields objects[#](#additional-fields-objects \"Permanent link\")\n\nThese objects define optional parameters. n8n displays them under **Additional Fields** in the GUI. Users can choose which parameters to set.\n\nThe objects must include:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17 | `displayName: 'Additional Fields', name: 'additionalFields', // The UI element type type: '' placeholder: 'Add Field', default: {}, displayOptions: {   // Set which resources and operations this field is available for   show: {     resource: [       // Resource names     ],     operation: [       // Operation names     ]   }, }` |\n\nFor more information about UI element types, refer to [UI elements](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/reference/ui-elements/)."

It uses:\n\n*   [Caddy](http://caddyserver.com/) (a reverse proxy) to allow access to the Server from the internet.\n*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to create and define the application components and how they work together.\n\nSelf-hosting knowledge prerequisites\n\nSelf-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:\n\n*   Setting up and configuring servers and containers\n*   Managing application resources and scaling\n*   Securing servers and applications\n*   Configuring n8n\n\nn8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).\n\nLatest and Next versions\n\nn8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).\n\nCurrent `latest`: 1.75.2  \nCurrent `next`: 1.76.1\n\n## Create a server[#](#create-a-server \"Permanent link\")\n\n1.  [Log in](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) to the Hetzner Cloud Console.\n2.  Select the project to host the server, or create a new project by selecting **\\+ NEW PROJECT**.\n3.  Select **\\+ CREATE SERVER** on the project tile you want to add it to.\n\nYou can change most of the settings to suit your needs, but as this guide uses Docker to run the application, under the **Image** section, select \"Docker CE\" from the **APPS** tab.\n\nType\n\nWhen creating the server, Hetzner asks you to choose a plan. For most usage levels, the CPX11 type is enough.\n\nSSH keys\n\nHetzner lets you choose between SSH and password-based authentication. SSH is more secure. The rest of this guide assumes you are using SSH.\n\n## Log in to your server[#](#log-in-to-your-server \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe rest of this guide requires you to log in to the server using a terminal with SSH. Refer to [Access with SSH/rsync/BorgBackup](https://docs.hetzner.com/robot/storage-box/access/access-ssh-rsync-borg) for more information. You can find the public IP in the listing of the servers in your project.\n\n## Install Docker Compose[#](#install-docker-compose \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Hetzner Docker app image doesn't have Docker compose installed. Install it with the following commands:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `apt update && apt -y upgrade apt install docker-compose-plugin` |\n\n## Clone configuration repository[#](#clone-configuration-repository \"Permanent link\")\n\nDocker Compose, n8n, and Caddy require a series of folders and configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy) into the root user folder of the server. The following steps will tell you which file to change and what changes to make.\n\nClone the repository with the following command:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docker-caddy.git` |\n\nAnd change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:\n\n## Default folders and files[#](#default-folders-and-files \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe host operating system (the server) copies the two folders you created to Docker containers to make them available to Docker. The two folders are:\n\n*   `caddy_config`: Holds the Caddy configuration files.\n*   `local_files`: A folder for files you upload or add using n8n.\n\n### Create Docker volume[#](#create-docker-volume \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo persist the Caddy cache between restarts and speed up start times, create [a Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) that Docker reuses between restarts:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `docker volume create caddy_data` |\n\nCreate a Docker volume for the n8n data:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `sudo docker volume create n8n_data` |\n\n## Set up DNS[#](#set-up-dns \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the server. The exact steps for this depend on your DNS provider, but typically you need to create a new \"A\" record for the n8n subdomain. DigitalOcean provide [An Introduction to DNS Terminology, Components, and Concepts](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-dns-terminology-components-and-concepts).\n\n## Open ports[#](#open-ports \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n runs as a web application, so the server needs to allow incoming access to traffic on port 80 for non-secure traffic, and port 443 for secure traffic.\n\nOpen the following ports in the server's firewall by running the following two commands:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `sudo ufw allow 80 sudo ufw allow 443` |\n\n## Configure n8n[#](#configure-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the Docker container. The example `.env` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own.\n\nOpen the file with the following command:\n\nThe file contains inline comments to help you know what to change.\n\nRefer to [Environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.\n\n## The Docker Compose file[#](#the-docker-compose-file \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) defines the services the application needs, in this case Caddy and n8n.\n\n*   The Caddy service definition defines the ports it uses and the local volumes to copy to the containers.\n*   The n8n service definition defines the ports it uses, the environment variables n8n needs to run (some defined in the `.env` file), and the volumes it needs to copy to the containers.\n\nThe Docker Compose file uses the environment variables set in the `.env` file, so you shouldn't need to change it's content, but to take a look, run the following command:\n\n## Configure Caddy[#](#configure-caddy \"Permanent link\")\n\nCaddy needs to know which domains it should serve, and which port to expose to the outside world. Edit the `Caddyfile` file in the `caddy_config` folder.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `nano caddy_config/Caddyfile` |\n\nChange the placeholder subdomain to yours. If you followed the steps to name the subdomain n8n, your full domain is similar to `n8n.example.com`. The `n8n` in the `reverse_proxy` setting tells Caddy to use the service definition defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `n8n.<domain>.<suffix> {     reverse_proxy n8n:5678 {       flush_interval -1     } }` |\n\n## Start Docker Compose[#](#start-docker-compose \"Permanent link\")\n\nStart n8n and Caddy with the following command:\n\nThis may take a few minutes.\n\n## Test your setup[#](#test-your-setup \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn your browser, open the URL formed of the subdomain and domain name defined earlier. Enter the user name and password defined earlier, and you should be able to access n8n.\n\n## Stop n8n and Caddy[#](#stop-n8n-and-caddy \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can stop n8n and Caddy with the following command:\n\n## Updating[#](#updating \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you run n8n using a Docker Compose file, follow these steps to update n8n:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `# Pull latest version docker compose pull  # Stop and remove older version docker compose down  # Start the container docker compose up -d` |\n\n## Next steps[#](#next-steps \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   Learn more about [configuring](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/overview) n8n.\n*   Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/)."

  "markdown": "# External storage for binary data\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/scaling/external-storage.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nFeature availability\n\n*   Available on Self-hosted Enterprise plans\n*   If you want access to this feature on Cloud Enterprise, [contact n8n](https://n8n-community.typeform.com/to/y9X2YuGa).\n\nn8n can store binary data produced by workflow executions externally. This feature is useful to avoid relying on the filesystem for storing large amounts of binary data.\n\nn8n will introduce external storage for other data types in the future.\n\n## Storing n8n's binary data in S3[#](#storing-n8ns-binary-data-in-s3 \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n supports [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) as an external store for binary data produced by workflow executions. You can use other S3-compatible services like Cloudflare R2 and Backblaze B2, but n8n doesn't officially support these.\n\nEnterprise-tier feature\n\nYou will need an [Enterprise license key](https://docs.n8n.io/enterprise-key/) for external storage. If your license key expires and you remain on S3 mode, the instance will be able to read from, but not write to, the S3 bucket.\n\n### Setup[#](#setup \"Permanent link\")\n\nCreate and configure a bucket following the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html). You can use the following policy, replacing `<bucket-name>` with the name of the bucket you created:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{ \t\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \t\"Statement\": [ \t\t{ \t\t\t\"Sid\": \"VisualEditor0\", \t\t\t\"Effect\": \"Allow\", \t\t\t\"Action\": [\"s3:*\"], \t\t\t\"Resource\": [\"arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>\", \"arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*\"] \t\t} \t] }` |\n\nSet a bucket-level lifecycle configuration so that S3 automatically deletes old binary data. n8n delegates pruning of binary data to S3, so setting a lifecycle configuration is required unless you want to preserve binary data indefinitely.\n\nOnce you finish creating the bucket, you will have a host, bucket name and region, and an access key ID and secret access key. You need to set them in n8n's environment:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_HOST=... # example: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_NAME=... export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_REGION=... export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY=... export N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_SECRET=...` |\n\nNo region\n\nIf your provider doesn't require a region, you can set `N8N_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET_REGION` to `'auto'`.\n\nTell n8n to store binary data in S3:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `export N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES=filesystem,s3 export N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE=s3` |\n\nRestart the server to load the new configuration.\n\n### Usage[#](#usage \"Permanent link\")\n\nAfter you enable S3, n8n writes and reads any new binary data to and from the S3 bucket. n8n writes binary data to your S3 bucket in this format:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `workflows/{workflowId}/executions/{executionId}/binary_data/{binaryFileId}` |\n\nn8n continues to read older binary data stored in the filesystem from the filesystem, if `filesystem` remains listed as an option in `N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES`.\n\nIf you store binary data in S3 and later switch to filesystem mode, the instance continues to read any data stored in S3, as long as `s3` remains listed in `N8N_AVAILABLE_BINARY_DATA_MODES` and your S3 credentials remain valid.\n\nBinary data pruning\n\nBinary data pruning operates on the active binary data mode. For example, if your instance stored data in S3, and you later switched to filesystem mode, n8n only prunes binary data in the filesystem. This may change in future."

  "markdown": "# Memory-related errors | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/hosting/scaling/memory-errors.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nn8n doesn't restrict the amount of data each node can fetch and process. While this gives you freedom, it can lead to errors when workflow executions require more memory than available. This page explains how to identify and avoid these errors.\n\n## Identifying out of memory situations[#](#identifying-out-of-memory-situations \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n provides error messages that warn you in some out of memory situations. For example, messages such as **Execution stopped at this node (n8n may have run out of memory while executing it)**.\n\nError messages including **Problem running workflow**, **Connection Lost**, or **503 Service Temporarily Unavailable** suggest that an n8n instance has become unavailable.\n\nWhen self-hosting n8n, you may also see error messages such as **Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory** in your server logs.\n\nOn n8n Cloud, or when using n8n's Docker image, n8n restarts automatically when encountering such an issue. However, when running n8n with npm you might need to restart it manually.\n\n## Typical causes[#](#typical-causes \"Permanent link\")\n\nSuch problems occur when a workflow execution requires more memory than available to an n8n instance. Factors increasing the memory usage for a workflow execution include:\n\n*   Amount of [JSON data](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-structure/).\n*   Size of binary data.\n*   Number of nodes in a workflow.\n*   Some nodes are memory-heavy: the [Code](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) node and the older Function node can increase memory consumption significantly.\n*   Manual or automatic workflow executions: manual executions increase memory consumption as n8n makes a copy of the data for the frontend.\n*   Additional workflows running at the same time.\n\n## Avoiding out of memory situations[#](#avoiding-out-of-memory-situations \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen encountering an out of memory situation, there are two options: either increase the amount of memory available to n8n or reduce the memory consumption.\n\n### Increase available memory[#](#increase-available-memory \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen self-hosting n8n, increasing the amount of memory available to n8n means provisioning your n8n instance with more memory. This may incur additional costs with your hosting provider.\n\nOn n8n cloud you need to upgrade to a larger plan.\n\n### Reduce memory consumption[#](#reduce-memory-consumption \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis approach is more complex and means re-building the workflows causing the issue. This section provides some guidelines on how to reduce memory consumption. Not all suggestions are applicable to all workflows.\n\n*   Split the data processed into smaller chunks. For example, instead of fetching 10,000 rows with each execution, process 200 rows with each execution.\n*   Avoid using the Code node where possible.\n*   Avoid manual executions when processing larger amounts of data.\n*   Split the workflow up into sub-workflows and ensure each sub-workflow returns a limited amount of data to its parent workflow.\n\nSplitting the workflow might seem counter-intuitive at first as it usually requires adding at least two more nodes: the [Loop Over Items](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) node to split up the items into smaller batches and the [Execute Workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.executeworkflow/) node to start the sub-workflow.\n\nHowever, as long as your sub-workflow does the heavy lifting for each batch and then returns only a small result set to the main workflow, this reduces memory consumption. This is because the sub-workflow only holds the data for the current batch in memory, after which the memory is free again.\n\n### Increase old memory[#](#increase-old-memory \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis applies to self-hosting n8n. When encountering **JavaScript heap out of memory** errors, it's often useful to allocate additional memory to the old memory section of the V8 JavaScript engine. To do this, set the appropriate [V8 option](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-old-space-sizesize-in-megabytes) `--max-old-space-size=SIZE` either through the CLI or through the `NODE_OPTIONS` [environment variable](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#node_optionsoptions)."

It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.\n\n## Hosting options[#](#hosting-options \"Permanent link\")\n\nAWS offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including EC2 (virtual machines), and EKS (containers running with Kubernetes).\n\nThis guide uses [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.\n\n## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe steps in this guide use a mix of the AWS UI and [the eksctl CLI tool for EKS](https://eksctl.io/).\n\nWhile not mentioned in the documentation for eksctl, you also need to [install the AWS CLI tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), and [configure authentication of the tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).\n\nSelf-hosting knowledge prerequisites\n\nSelf-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:\n\n*   Setting up and configuring servers and containers\n*   Managing application resources and scaling\n*   Securing servers and applications\n*   Configuring n8n\n\nn8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).\n\nLatest and Next versions\n\nn8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).\n\nCurrent `latest`: 1.75.2  \nCurrent `next`: 1.76.1\n\n## Create a cluster[#](#create-a-cluster \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse the eksctl tool to create a cluster specifying a name and a region with the following command:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `eksctl create cluster --name n8n --region <your-aws-region>` |\n\nThis can take a while to create the cluster.\n\nOnce the cluster is created, eksctl automatically sets the kubectl context to the cluster.\n\n## Clone configuration repository[#](#clone-configuration-repository \"Permanent link\")\n\nKubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting/tree/aws). The following steps tell you what each file does, and what settings you need to change.\n\nClone the repository with the following command:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b aws` |\n\nAnd change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `cd n8n-kubernetes-hosting` |\n\n## Configure Postgres[#](#configure-postgres \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.\n\n### Configure volume for persistent storage[#](#configure-volume-for-persistent-storage \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default AWS storage class, [gp2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/general-purpose.html#EBSVolumeTypes_gp2), is suitable for this purpose. This is defined in the `postgres-claaim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `… spec:   storageClassName: gp2   accessModes:     - ReadWriteOnce …` |\n\n### Postgres environment variables[#](#postgres-environment-variables \"Permanent link\")\n\nPostgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.\n\nThe example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with values of your own for user details and the database to use.\n\nThe `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.\n\n## Configure n8n[#](#configure-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\n### Create a volume for file storage[#](#create-a-volume-for-file-storage \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhile not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes helps maintain files uploaded while using n8n and if you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts, which saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.\n\nThe `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `… volumes:   - name: n8n-claim0     persistentVolumeClaim:       claimName: n8n-claim0 …` |\n\n### Pod resources[#](#pod-resources \"Permanent link\")\n\n[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) lets you specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` file:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `… resources:   requests:     memory: \"250Mi\"   limits:     memory: \"500Mi\" …` |\n\nThis defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:\n\n*   **Start**: 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable\n*   **Pro (10k executions)**: 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable\n*   **Pro (50k executions)**: 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable\n\n### Optional: Environment variables[#](#optional-environment-variables \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.\n\nCreate an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.\n\n## Deployments[#](#deployments \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.\n\nThe manifests define the following:\n\n*   Send the environment variables defined to each application pod\n*   Define the container image to use\n*   Set resource consumption limits\n*   The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.\n*   Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.\n\nThe two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively by default.\n\n## Send to Kubernetes cluster[#](#send-to-kubernetes-cluster \"Permanent link\")\n\nSend all the manifests to the cluster by running the following command in the `n8n-kubernetes-hosting` directory:\n\nNamespace error\n\nYou may see an error message about not finding an \"n8n\" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml` |\n\n## Set up DNS[#](#set-up-dns \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to a static address of the instance.\n\nTo find the address of the n8n service running on the instance:\n\n1.  Open the **Clusters** section of the **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service** page in the AWS console.\n2.  Select the name of the cluster to open its configuration page.\n3.  Select the **Resources** tab, then **Service and networking** > **Services**.\n4.  Select the **n8n** service and copy the **Load balancer URLs** value. Use this value suffixed with the n8n service port (5678) for DNS.\n\nUse HTTP\n\nThis guide uses HTTP connections for the services it defines, for example in `n8n-deployment.yaml`. However, if you click the **Load balancer URLs** value, EKS takes you to an \"HTTPS\" URL which results in an error. To solve this, when you open the n8n subdomain, make sure to use HTTP.\n\n## Delete resources[#](#delete-resources \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you need to delete the setup, you can remove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:\n\n## Next steps[#](#next-steps \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   Learn more about [configuring](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/overview) n8n.\n*   Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/)."

It uses n8n with Postgres as a database backend using Kubernetes to manage the necessary resources and reverse proxy.\n\n## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou need [The Azure command line tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)\n\nSelf-hosting knowledge prerequisites\n\nSelf-hosting n8n requires technical knowledge, including:\n\n*   Setting up and configuring servers and containers\n*   Managing application resources and scaling\n*   Securing servers and applications\n*   Configuring n8n\n\nn8n recommends self-hosting for expert users. Mistakes can lead to data loss, security issues, and downtime. If you aren't experienced at managing servers, n8n recommends [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/).\n\nLatest and Next versions\n\nn8n releases a new minor version most weeks. The `latest` version is for production use. `next` is the most recent release. You should treat `next` as a beta: it may be unstable. To report issues, use the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/c/questions/12).\n\nCurrent `latest`: 1.75.2  \nCurrent `next`: 1.76.1\n\n## Hosting options[#](#hosting-options \"Permanent link\")\n\nAzure offers several ways suitable for hosting n8n, including Azure Container Instances (optimized for running containers), Linux Virtual Machines, and Azure Kubernetes Service (containers running with Kubernetes).\n\nThis guide uses the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as the hosting option. Using Kubernetes requires some additional complexity and configuration, but is the best method for scaling n8n as demand changes.\n\nThe steps in this guide use a mix of the Azure UI and command line tool, but you can use either to accomplish most tasks.\n\n## Open the Azure Kubernetes Service[#](#open-the-azure-kubernetes-service \"Permanent link\")\n\nFrom [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) select **Kubernetes services**.\n\n## Create a cluster[#](#create-a-cluster \"Permanent link\")\n\nFrom the Kubernetes services page, select **Create** > **Create a Kubernetes cluster**.\n\nYou can select any of the configuration options that suit your needs, then select **Create** when done.\n\n## Set Kubectl context[#](#set-kubectl-context \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe remainder of the steps in this guide require you to set the Azure instance as the Kubectl context. You can find the connection details for a cluster instance by opening its details page and then the **Connect** button. The resulting code snippets shows the steps to paste and run into a terminal to change your local Kubernetes settings to use the new cluster.\n\n## Clone configuration repository[#](#clone-configuration-repository \"Permanent link\")\n\nKubernetes and n8n require a series of configuration files. You can clone these from [this repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting/tree/azure). The following steps tell you which file configures what and what you need to change.\n\nClone the repository with the following command:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-kubernetes-hosting.git -b azure` |\n\nAnd change directory to the root of the repository you cloned:\n\n## Configure Postgres[#](#configure-postgres \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor larger scale n8n deployments, Postgres provides a more robust database backend than SQLite.\n\n### Configure volume for persistent storage[#](#configure-volume-for-persistent-storage \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo maintain data between pod restarts, the Postgres deployment needs a persistent volume. The default storage class is suitable for this purpose and is defined in the `postgres-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest.\n\n### Postgres environment variables[#](#postgres-environment-variables \"Permanent link\")\n\nPostgres needs some environment variables set to pass to the application running in the containers.\n\nThe example `postgres-secret.yaml` file contains placeholders you need to replace with your own values. Postgres will use these details when creating the database..\n\nThe `postgres-deployment.yaml` manifest then uses the values from this manifest file to send to the application pods.\n\n## Configure n8n[#](#configure-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\n### Create a volume for file storage[#](#create-a-volume-for-file-storage \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhile not essential for running n8n, using persistent volumes is required for:\n\n*   Using nodes that interact with files, such as the binary data node.\n*   If you want to persist [manual n8n encryption keys](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment/) between restarts. This saves a file containing the key into file storage during startup.\n\nThe `n8n-claim0-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml` manifest creates this, and the n8n Deployment mounts that claim in the `volumes` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` manifest.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `… volumes:   - name: n8n-claim0     persistentVolumeClaim:       claimName: n8n-claim0 …` |\n\n### Pod resources[#](#pod-resources \"Permanent link\")\n\n[Kubernetes lets you](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) optionally specify the minimum resources application containers need and the limits they can run to. The example YAML files cloned above contain the following in the `resources` section of the `n8n-deployment.yaml` file:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `… resources:   requests:     memory: \"250Mi\"   limits:     memory: \"500Mi\" …` |\n\nThis defines a minimum of 250mb per container, a maximum of 500mb, and lets Kubernetes handle CPU. You can change these values to match your own needs. As a guide, here are the resources values for the n8n cloud offerings:\n\n*   **Start**: 320mb RAM, 10 millicore CPU burstable\n*   **Pro (10k executions)**: 640mb RAM, 20 millicore CPU burstable\n*   **Pro (50k executions)**: 1280mb RAM, 80 millicore CPU burstable\n\n### Optional: Environment variables[#](#optional-environment-variables \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can configure n8n settings and behaviors using environment variables.\n\nCreate an `n8n-secret.yaml` file. Refer to [Environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) for n8n environment variables details.\n\n## Deployments[#](#deployments \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe two deployment manifests (`n8n-deployment.yaml` and `postgres-deployment.yaml`) define the n8n and Postgres applications to Kubernetes.\n\nThe manifests define the following:\n\n*   Send the environment variables defined to each application pod\n*   Define the container image to use\n*   Set resource consumption limits with the `resources` object\n*   The `volumes` defined earlier and `volumeMounts` to define the path in the container to mount volumes.\n*   Scaling and restart policies. The example manifests define one instance of each pod. You should change this to meet your needs.\n\n## Services[#](#services \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe two service manifests (`postgres-service.yaml` and `n8n-service.yaml`) expose the services to the outside world using the Kubernetes load balancer using ports 5432 and 5678 respectively.\n\n## Send to Kubernetes cluster[#](#send-to-kubernetes-cluster \"Permanent link\")\n\nSend all the manifests to the cluster with the following command:\n\nNamespace error\n\nYou may see an error message about not finding an \"n8n\" namespace as that resources isn't ready yet. You can run the same command again, or apply the namespace manifest first with the following command:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml` |\n\n## Set up DNS[#](#set-up-dns \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n typically operates on a subdomain. Create a DNS record with your provider for the subdomain and point it to the IP address of the n8n service. Find the IP address of the n8n service from the **Services & ingresses** menu item of the cluster you want to use under the **External IP** column. You need to add the n8n port, \"5678\" to the URL.\n\nStatic IP addresses with AKS\n\n[Read this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/static-ip) for more details on how to use a static IP address with AKS.\n\n## Delete resources[#](#delete-resources \"Permanent link\")\n\nRemove the resources created by the manifests with the following command:\n\n## Next steps[#](#next-steps \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   Learn more about [configuring](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/) and [scaling](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/scaling/overview) n8n.\n*   Or explore using n8n: try the [Quickstarts](https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/)."

Create a new project for your n8n deployment from your Google Cloud Console: select the project dropdown menu and then the **NEW PROJECT** button. Then select the newly created project. As you follow the other steps in this guide, make sure you have the correct project selected.\n\n## Enable the Kubernetes Engine API[#](#enable-the-kubernetes-engine-api \"Permanent link\")\n\nGKE isn't enabled by default. Search for \"Kubernetes\" in the top search bar and select \"Kubernetes Engine\" from the results.\n\nSelect **ENABLE** to enable the Kubernetes Engine API for this project.\n\n## Create a cluster[#](#create-a-cluster \"Permanent link\")\n\nFrom the [GKE service page](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list/overview), select **Clusters** > **CREATE**. Make sure you select the \"Standard\" cluster option, n8n doesn't work with an \"Autopilot\" cluster.

Running Postgres on GCP requires a specific Kubernetes Storage Class. You can read [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/deploying-highly-available-postgresql-with-gke) for specifics, but the `storage.yaml` manifest creates it for you. You may want to change the regions to create the storage in under the `allowedTopologies` > `matchedLabelExpressions` > `values` key.

The other fields are optional. The default method is `GET`.\n\nSome notes about the possible fields:\n\n*   `body`: you can use a regular JavaScript object for JSON payload, a buffer for file uploads, an instance of FormData for `multipart/form-data`, and `URLSearchParams` for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.\n*   `headers`: a key-value pair.\n    *   If `body` is an instance of `FormData` then n8n adds `content-type: multipart/form-data` automatically.\n    *   If `body` is an instance of `URLSearchParams`, then n8n adds `content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.\n    *   To override this behavior, set a `content-type` header.\n*   `arrayFormat`: if your query string contains an array of data, such as `const qs = {IDs: [15,17]}`, the value of `arrayFormat` defines how n8n formats it.\n    *   `indices` (default): `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a[0]=b&a[1]=c`\n    *   `brackets`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a[]=b&a[]=c`\n    *   `repeat`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a=b&a=c`\n    *   `comma`: `{ a: ['b', 'c'] }` as `a=b,c`\n*   `auth`: Used for Basic auth. Provide `username` and `password`. n8n recommends omitting this, and using `helpers.httpRequestWithAuthentication(...)` instead.\n*   `disableFollowRedirect`: By default, n8n follows redirects. You can set this to true to prevent this from happening.\n*   `skipSslCertificateValidation`: Used for calling HTTPS services without proper certificate\n*   `returnFullResponse`: Instead of returning just the body, returns an object with more data in the following format: `{body: body, headers: object, statusCode: 200, statusMessage: 'OK'}`\n*   `encoding`: n8n can detect the content type, but you can specify `arrayBuffer` to receive a Buffer you can read from and interact with.\n\n## Example[#](#example \"Permanent link\")\n\nFor an example, refer to the [Mattermost node](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/nodes-base/nodes/Mattermost/v1/MattermostV1.node.ts).\n\n## Deprecation of the previous helper[#](#deprecation-of-the-previous-helper \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe previous helper implementation using `this.helpers.request(options)` used and exposed the `request-promise` library. This was removed in version 1.\n\nTo minimize incompatibility, n8n made a transparent conversion to another library called `Axios`.\n\nIf you are having issues, please report them in the [Community Forums](https://community.n8n.io/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/issues).\n\n## Migration guide to the new helper[#](#migration-guide-to-the-new-helper \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe new helper is much more robust, library agnostic, and easier to use.\n\nNew nodes should all use the new helper. You should strongly consider migrating existing custom nodes to the new helper. These are the main considerations when migrating:\n\n*   Accepts `url`. Doesn't accept `uri`.\n*   `encoding: null` now must be `encoding: arrayBuffer`.\n*   `rejectUnauthorized: false` is now `skipSslCertificateValidation: true`\n*   Use `body` according to `content-type` headers to clarify the payload.\n*   `resolveWithFullResponse` is now `returnFullResponse` and has similar behavior"

If you're using declarative style, n8n handles paired items for you automatically.\n\nUse n8n's item linking to access data from items that precede the current item. n8n needs to know which input item a given output item comes from.

As a node developer, you must ensure any items returned by your node support this.\n\nThis applies to programmatic nodes (including trigger nodes). You don't need to consider item linking when building a declarative-style node. Refer to [Choose your node building approach](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/plan/choose-node-method/) for more information on node styles.\n\nStart by reading [Item linking concepts](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/item-linking-concepts/), which provides a conceptual overview of item linking, and details of the scenarios where n8n can handle the linking automatically.\n\nIf you need to handle item linking manually, do this by setting `pairedItem` on each item your node returns:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20 | `// Use the pairedItem information of the incoming item newItem = { \t\"json\": { . . . }, \t\"pairedItem\": { \t\t\"item\": item.pairedItem, \t\t// Optional: choose the input to use \t\t// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs \t\t\"input\": 0 };  // Or set the index manually newItem = { \t\t\"json\": { . . . } \t\t\"pairedItem\": { \t\t\t\"item\": i, \t\t\t// Optional: choose the input to use \t\t\t// Set this if your node combines multiple inputs \t\t\t\"input\": 0 \t\t}, };` |"

The linter detects issues and automatically fixes them to help you follow best practices.\n\n`eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base` contains a [collection of rules](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base#ruleset) for node files (`*.node.ts`), resource description files (`*Description.ts`), credential files (`*.credentials.ts`), and the `package.json` of a community package.\n\n## Setup[#](#setup \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf using the [n8n node starter](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter): Run `npm install` in the starter project to install all dependencies. Once the installation finishes, the linter is available to you.\n\nIf using VS Code, install the [ESLint VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.VS%20Code-eslint). For other IDEs, refer to their ESLint integrations.\n\nDon't edit the configuration file\n\n[`.eslintrc.js`](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/.eslintrc.js) contains the configuration for `eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base`. Don't edit this file.\n\n## Usage[#](#usage \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can use the linter in a community package or in the main n8n repository.\n\n### Linting[#](#linting \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn a community package, the linter runs automatically after installing dependencies and before publishing the package to npm. In the [main n8n repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n), the linter runs automatically using GitHub Actions whenever you push to your pull request.\n\nIn both cases, VS Code lints in the background as you work on your project. Hover over a detected issue to see a full description of the linting and a link to further information.\n\nYou can also run the linter manually:\n\n*   Run `npm run lint` to lint and view detected issues in your console.\n*   Run `npm run lintfix` to lint and automatically fix issues. The linter fixes violations of rules [marked as automatically fixable](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base#ruleset).\n\nBoth commands can run in the root directory of your community package, or in `/packages/nodes-base/` in the main repository.\n\n### Exceptions[#](#exceptions \"Permanent link\")\n\nInstead of fixing a rule violation, you can also make an exception for it, so the linter doesn't flag it.\n\nTo make a lint exception from VS Code: hover over the issue and click on `Quick fix` (or `cmd+.` in macOS) and select **Disable {rule} for this line**. Only disable rules for a line where you have good reason to. If you think the linter is incorrectly reporting an issue, please [report it in the linter repository](https://github.com/ivov/eslint-plugin-n8n-nodes-base/issues).\n\nTo add a lint exception to a single file, add a code comment. In particular, TSLint rules may not show up in VS Code and may need to be turned off using code comments. Refer to the [TSLint documentation](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/rule-flags/) for more guidance."

  "markdown": "# Custom API actions for existing nodes\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/custom-operations.md \"Edit this page\")\n\n## Custom API operations[#](#custom-api-operations \"Permanent link\")\n\nOne of the most complex parts of setting up API calls is managing authentication. n8n provides credentials support for operations and services beyond those supported by built-in nodes.\n\n*   Custom operations for existing nodes: n8n supplies hundreds of nodes to create workflows that link multiple products. However, some nodes don't include all the possible operations supported by a product's API. You can work around this by making a custom API call using the [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node.\n*   Credential-only nodes: n8n includes credential-only nodes. These are integrations where n8n supports setting up credentials for use in the HTTP Request node, but doesn't provide a standalone node. You can find a credential-only node in the nodes panel, as you would for any other integration.\n\n## Predefined credential types[#](#predefined-credential-types \"Permanent link\")\n\nA predefined credential type is a credential that already exists in n8n. You can use predefined credential types instead of generic credentials in the HTTP Request node.\n\nFor example: you create an Asana credential, for use with the Asana node. Later, you want to perform an operation that isn't supported by the Asana node, using Asana's API. You can use your existing Asana credential in the HTTP Request node to perform the operation, without additional authentication setup.\n\n### Using predefined credential types[#](#using-predefined-credential-types \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo use a predefined credential type:\n\n1.  Open your HTTP Request node, or add a new one to your workflow.\n2.  In **Authentication**, select **Predefined Credential Type**.\n3.  In **Credential Type**, select the API you want to use.\n4.  In **Credential for `<API name>`**, you can:\n    1.  Select an existing credential for that platform, if available.\n    2.  Select **Create New** to create a new credential.\n\n### Credential scopes[#](#credential-scopes \"Permanent link\")\n\nSome existing credential types have specific scopes: endpoints that they work with. n8n warns you about this when you select the credential type.\n\nFor example, follow the steps in [Using predefined credential types](#using-predefined-credential-types), and select **Google Calendar OAuth2 API** as your **Credential Type**. n8n displays a box listing the two endpoints you can use this credential type with:\n\n![The scopes box](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/custom-operations/scopes.png)"

  "markdown": "# Handling API rate limits | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/rate-limits.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nAPI rate limits are restrictions on request frequency. For example, an API may limit the number of requests you can make per minute, or per day.\n\nAPIs can also limits how much data you can send in one request, or how much data the API sends in a single response.\n\n## Identify rate limit issues[#](#identify-rate-limit-issues \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen an n8n node hits a rate limit, it errors. n8n displays the error message in the node output panel. This includes the error message from the service.\n\nIf n8n received error 429 (too many requests) from the service, the error message is **The service is receiving too many requests from you**.\n\nTo check the rate limits for the service you're using, refer to the API documentation for the service.\n\n## Handle rate limits for integrations[#](#handle-rate-limits-for-integrations \"Permanent link\")\n\nThere are two ways to handle rate limits in n8n's integrations: using the Retry On Fail setting, or using a combination of the [Loop Over Items](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) and [Wait](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) nodes:\n\n*   Retry On Fail adds a pause between API request attempts.\n*   With Loop Over Items and Wait you can break you request data into smaller chunks, as well as pausing between requests.\n\n### Enable Retry On Fail[#](#enable-retry-on-fail \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen you enable Retry On Fail, the node automatically tries the request again if it fails the first time.\n\n1.  Open the node.\n2.  Select **Settings**.\n3.  Enable the **Retry On Fail** toggle.\n4.  Configure the retry settings: if using this to work around rate limits, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to more than the rate limit. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000` to allow a 1 second wait.\n\n### Use Loop Over Items and Wait[#](#use-loop-over-items-and-wait \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse the Loop Over Items node to batch the input items, and the Wait node to introduce a pause between each request.\n\n1.  Add the Loop Over Items node before the node that calls the API. Refer to [Loop Over Items](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitinbatches/) for information on how to configure the node.\n2.  Add the Wait node after the node that calls the API, and connect it back to the Loop Over Items node. Refer to [Wait](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.wait/) for information on how to configure the node.\n\nFor example, to handle rate limits when using OpenAI:\n\n![\"Screenshot of a workflow using the Loop Over Items node and Wait node to handle API rate limits for the OpenAI APIs\"](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/rate-limits/loop-wait.png)\n\n## Handle rate limits in the HTTP Request node[#](#handle-rate-limits-in-the-http-request-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe HTTP Request node has built-in settings for handling rate limits and large amounts of data.\n\n### Batch requests[#](#batch-requests \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse the Batching option to send more than one request, reducing the request size, and introducing a pause between requests. This is the equivalent of using Loop Over Items and Wait.\n\n1.  In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option** > **Batching**.\n2.  Set **Items per Batch**: this is the number of input items to include in each request.\n3.  Set **Batch Interval (ms)** to introduce a delay between requests. For example, if the API you're using allows one request per second, set **Wait Between Tries (ms)** to `1000` to allow a 1 second wait.\n\n### Paginate results[#](#paginate-results \"Permanent link\")\n\nAPIs paginate their results when they need to send more data than they can handle in a single response. For more information on pagination in the HTTP Request node, refer to [HTTP Request node | Pagination](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/#pagination)."

You want to extract some of that data for use in the workflow.\n\nYour webhook data looks similar to this:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15 | `[   {     \"headers\": {       \"host\": \"n8n.instance.address\",       ...     },     \"params\": {},     \"query\": {},     \"body\": {       \"name\": \"Jim\",       \"age\": 30,       \"city\": \"New York\"     }   } ]` |\n\nIn the next node in the workflow, you want to get just the value of `city`. You can use the following expression:\n\nThis expression:\n\n1.  Accesses the incoming JSON-formatted data using n8n's custom `$json` variable.\n2.  Finds the value of `city` (in this example, \"New York\"). Note that this example uses JMESPath syntax to query the JSON data. You can also write this expression as `{{$json['body']['city']}}`.\n\n### Example: Writing longer JavaScript[#](#example-writing-longer-javascript \"Permanent link\")\n\nAn expression contains one line of JavaScript. This means you cannot do things like variable assignments or multiple standalone operations.\n\nTo understand the limitations of JavaScript in expressions, and start thinking about workarounds, look at the following two pieces of code.

  "markdown": "# Using the Code node | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/code-node.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nUse the Code node to write custom JavaScript or Python and run it as a step in your workflow.\n\nExamples and templates\n\nFor usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's [Code integrations](https://n8n.io/integrations/code/) page.\n\n## Usage[#](#usage \"Permanent link\")\n\nHow to use the Code node.\n\n### Choose a mode[#](#choose-a-mode \"Permanent link\")\n\nThere are two modes:\n\n*   **Run Once for All Items**: this is the default. When your workflow runs, the code in the code node executes once, regardless of how many input items there are.\n*   **Run Once for Each Item**: choose this if you want your code to run for every input item.\n\n## JavaScript[#](#javascript \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Code node supports Node.js.\n\n### Supported JavaScript features[#](#supported-javascript-features \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Code node supports:\n\n*   Promises. Instead of returning the items directly, you can return a promise which resolves accordingly.\n*   Writing to your browser console using `console.log`. This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting your workflows.\n\n### External libraries[#](#external-libraries \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you self-host n8n, you can import and use built-in and external npm modules in the Code node. To learn how to enable external modules, refer to the [Enable modules in Code node](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/configuration/configuration-examples/modules-in-code-node/) guide.\n\nIf you use n8n Cloud, you can't import external npm modules. n8n makes two modules available for you:\n\n*   [crypto Node.js module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/crypto.html)\n*   [moment npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)\n\n### Built-in methods and variables[#](#built-in-methods-and-variables \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/overview/) for more information.\n\nThe syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `$variableName` or `$methodName()`. Type `$` in the Code node or expressions editor to see a list of suggested methods and variables.\n\n## Python[#](#python \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n added Python support in version 1.0. It doesn't include a Python executable. Instead, n8n provides Python support using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), which is a port of CPython to WebAssembly. This limits the available Python packages to the [Packages included with Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html#packages-in-pyodide). n8n downloads the package automatically the first time you use it.\n\nSlower than JavaScript\n\nThe Code node takes longer to process Python than JavaScript. This is due to the extra compilation steps.\n\n### Built-in methods and variables[#](#built-in-methods-and-variables_1 \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n provides built-in methods and variables for working with data and accessing n8n data. Refer to [Built-in methods and variables](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/overview/) for more information.\n\nThe syntax to use the built-in methods and variables is `_variableName` or `_methodName()`. Type `_` in the Code node to see a list of suggested methods and variables.\n\n## File system and HTTP requests[#](#file-system-and-http-requests \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can't access the file system or make HTTP requests. Use the following nodes instead:\n\n*   [Read/Write File From Disk](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/)\n*   [HTTP Request](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/)\n\n## Coding in n8n[#](#coding-in-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nThere are two places where you can use code in n8n: the Code node and the expressions editor. When using either area, there are some key concepts you need to know, as well as some built-in methods and variables to help with common tasks.\n\n### Key concepts[#](#key-concepts \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen working with the Code node, you need to understand the following concepts:\n\n*   [Data structure](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-structure/): understand the data you receive in the Code node, and requirements for outputting data from the node.\n*   [Item linking](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-mapping/data-item-linking/): learn how data items work, and how to link to items from previous nodes. You need to handle item linking in your code when the number of input and output items doesn't match.\n\n### Built-in methods and variables[#](#built-in-methods-and-variables_2 \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n includes built-in methods and variables. These provide support for:\n\n*   Accessing specific item data\n*   Accessing data about workflows, executions, and your n8n environment\n*   Convenience variables to help with data and time\n\nRefer to [Built-in methods and variables](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/overview) for more information.\n\n## Use AI in the Code node[#](#use-ai-in-the-code-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nFeature availability\n\nAI assistance in the Code node is available to Cloud users. It isn't available in self-hosted n8n.\n\nAI generated code overwrites your code\n\nIf you've already written some code on the **Code** tab, the AI generated code will replace it. n8n recommends using AI as a starting point to create your initial code, then editing it as needed.\n\nTo use ChatGPT to generate code in the Code node:\n\n1.  In the Code node, set **Language** to **JavaScript**.\n2.  Select the **Ask AI** tab.\n3.  Write your query.\n4.  Select **Generate Code**. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the **Code** tab."

Select **Generate Code**. n8n sends your query to ChatGPT, then displays the result in the **Code** tab.\n\n## Usage limits[#](#usage-limits \"Permanent link\")\n\nDuring the trial phase there are no usage limits. If n8n makes the feature permanent, there may be usage limits as part of your pricing tier.\n\n## Feature limits[#](#feature-limits \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe ChatGPT implementation in n8n has the following limitations:\n\n*   The AI writes code that manipulates data from the n8n workflow. You can't ask it to pull in data from other sources.\n*   The AI doesn't know your data, just the schema, so you need to tell it things like how to find the data you want to extract, or how to check for null.\n*   Nodes before the Code node must execute and deliver data to the Code node before you run your AI query.\n*   Doesn't work with large incoming data schemas.\n*   May have issues if there are a lot of nodes before the code node.\n\n## Writing good prompts[#](#writing-good-prompts \"Permanent link\")\n\nWriting good prompts increases the chance of getting useful code back.\n\nSome general tips:\n\n*   Provide examples: if possible, give a sample expected output. This helps the AI to better understand the transformation or logic you’re aiming for.\n*   Describe the processing steps: if there are specific processing steps or logic that should apply to the data, list them in sequence. For example: \"First, filter out all users under 18. Then, sort the remaining users by their last name.\"\n*   Avoid ambiguities: while the AI understands various instructions, being clear and direct ensures you get the most accurate code. Instead of saying \"Get the older users,\" you might say \"Filter users who are 60 years and above.\"\n*   Be clear about what you expect as the output. Do you want the data transformed, filtered, aggregated, or sorted? Provide as much detail as possible.\n\nAnd some n8n-specific guidance:\n\n*   Think about the input data: make sure ChatGPT knows which pieces of the data you want to access, and what the incoming data represents. You may need to tell ChatGPT about the availability of n8n's built-in methods and variables.\n*   Declare interactions between nodes: if your logic involves data from multiple nodes, specify how they should interact. \"Merge the output of 'Node A' with 'Node B' based on the 'userID' property\". if you prefer data to come from certain nodes or to ignore others, be clear: \"Only consider data from the 'Purchases' node and ignore the 'Refunds' node.\"\n*   Ensure the output is compatible with n8n. Refer to [Data structure](https://docs.n8n.io/data/data-structure/) for more information on the data structure n8n requires.\n\n### Example prompts[#](#example-prompts \"Permanent link\")\n\nThese examples show a range of possible prompts and tasks.\n\n#### Example 1: Find a piece of data inside a second dataset[#](#example-1-find-a-piece-of-data-inside-a-second-dataset \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo try the example yourself, [download the example workflow](https://docs.n8n.io/_workflows/ai-code/find-a-piece-of-data.json) and import it into n8n.\n\nIn the third Code node, enter this prompt:\n\n> The slack data contains only one item.

  "markdown": "# Expressions common issues | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/cookbook/expressions/common-issues.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nHere are some common errors and issues related to [expressions](https://docs.n8n.io/code/expressions/) and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.\n\n## The 'JSON Output' in item 0 contains invalid JSON[#](#the-json-output-in-item-0-contains-invalid-json \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis error occurs when you use JSON mode but don't provide a valid JSON object. Depending on the problem with the JSON object, the error sometimes display as `The 'JSON Output' in item 0 does not contain a valid JSON object`.\n\nTo resolve this, make sure that the code you provide is valid JSON:\n\n*   Check the JSON with a [JSON validator](https://jsonlint.com/).\n*   Check that your JSON object doesn't reference undefined input data. This may occur if the incoming data doesn't always include the same fields.\n\n## Can't get data for expression[#](#cant-get-data-for-expression \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis error occurs when n8n can't retrieve the data referenced by an expression. Often, this happens when the preceding node hasn't been run yet.\n\nAnother variation of this may appear as `Referenced node is unexecuted`. In that case, the full text of this error will tell you the exact node that isn't executing in this format:\n\n> An expression references the node '<node-name>', but it hasn’t been executed yet. Either change the expression, or re-wire your workflow to make sure that node executes first.\n\nTo begin troubleshooting, test the workflow up to the named node.\n\nFor nodes that use JavaScript or other custom code, you can check if a previous node has executed before trying to use its value by checking the following:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `$(\"<node-name>\").isExecuted` |\n\nAs an example, this JSON references the parameters of the input data. This error will display if you test this step without connecting it to another node:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{   \"my_field_1\": {{ $input.params }} }` |\n\n## Invalid syntax[#](#invalid-syntax \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis error occurs when you use an expression that has a syntax error.\n\nFor example, the expression in this JSON includes a trailing period, which results in an invalid syntax error:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{   \"my_field_1\": \"value\",   \"my_field_2\": {{ $('If').item.json. }} }` |\n\nTo resolve this error, check your [expression syntax](https://www.notion.so/code/expressions/) to make sure they follow the expected format."

Check the API documentation for the API you're using for details. You need to find out things like:\n\n*   Does the API provide the URL for the next page?\n*   Are there API-specific limits on page size or page number?\n*   The structure of the data that the API returns.\n\nIn the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option** > **Pagination**.\n\n## Use a URL from the response to get the next page using `$response`[#](#use-a-url-from-the-response-to-get-the-next-page-using-response \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf the API returns the URL of the next page in its response:\n\n1.  Set **Pagination Mode** to **Response Contains Next URL**. n8n displays the parameters for this option.\n2.  In **Next URL**, use an expression to set the URL. The exact expression depends on the data returned by your API. For example, if the API includes a parameter called `next-page` in the response body:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `{{ $response.body[\"next-page\"] }}` |\n    \n\n## Get the next page by number using `$pageCount`[#](#get-the-next-page-by-number-using-pagecount \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf the API you're using supports targeting a specific page by number:\n\n1.  Set **Pagination Mode** to **Update a Parameter in Each Request**.\n2.  Set **Type** to **Query**.\n3.  Enter the **Name** of the query parameter. This depends on your API and is usually described in its documentation. For example, some APIs use a query parameter named `page` to set the page. So **Name** would be `page`.\n4.  Hover over **Value** and toggle **Expression** on.\n5.  Enter `{{ $pageCount + 1 }}`\n\n`$pageCount` is the number of pages the HTTP Request node has fetched. It starts at zero. Most API pagination counts from one (the first page is page one). This means that adding `+1` to `$pageCount` means the node fetches page one on its first loop, page two on its second, and so on.\n\n## Navigate pagination through body parameters[#](#navigate-pagination-through-body-parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf the API you're using allows you to paginate through the body parameters:\n\n1.  Set the HTTP Request Method to **POST**\n2.  Set **Pagination Mode** to **Update a Parameter in Each Request**.\n3.  Select **Body** in the **Type** parameter.\n4.  Enter the **Name** of the body parameter. This depends on the API you're using. `page` is a common key name.\n5.  Hover over **Value** and toggle **Expression** on.\n6.  Enter `{{ $pageCount + 1 }}`\n\n## Set the page size in the query[#](#set-the-page-size-in-the-query \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf the API you're using supports choosing the page size in the query:\n\n1.  Select **Send Query Parameters** in main node parameters (this is the parameters you see when you first open the node, not the settings within options).\n2.  Enter the **Name** of the query parameter. This depends on your API. For example, a lot of APIs use a query parameter named `limit` to set page size. So **Name** would be `limit`.\n3.  In **Value**, enter your page size."

  "markdown": "# Tutorial: Build an AI workflow in n8n\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/advanced-ai/intro-tutorial.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nThis tutorial introduces LangChain functionality in n8n. You can work through it with no prior knowledge of LangChain, AI, or n8n. However, if you've never used n8n before, you should also do the [Longer quickstart](https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/longer-introduction/), which introduces key n8n concepts.\n\n![\"Screenshot of the workflow\"](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/advanced-ai/ai-tutorial-outcome.png)\n\nIn this tutorial you will:\n\n*   Create a workflow from scratch. It uses the Chat Trigger to simulate and test chat interactions, ChatGPT to power the chat functionality, and a custom tool to connect to other n8n workflows.\n*   Understand key concepts, including:\n    *   The role of agents, models, and tools when building AI functionality.\n    *   Cluster nodes in n8n: groups of root and sub-node.\n    *   Loading your own data into AI workflows.\n\n## Step one: Sign up for n8n[#](#step-one-sign-up-for-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nSkip this section if you've already installed n8n or signed up for a Cloud account\n\nn8n is available as a [Cloud](https://docs.n8n.io/choose-n8n/cloud/) service, [npm](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/npm/) module, and [Docker](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/) image. For this quickstart, n8n recommends using Cloud. A free trial is available for new users.\n\nn8n version 1.21.0 or above\n\nThis tutorial requires n8n version 1.21.0 or above.\n\n## Step two: Create a new workflow[#](#step-two-create-a-new-workflow \"Permanent link\")\n\nWhen you open n8n, you'll see either:\n\n*   An empty workflow: if you have no workflows and you're logging in for the first time. Use this workflow.\n*   The **Workflows** list on the **Overview** page. Select the ![universal create resource icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/common-icons/universal-resource-button.png) **button** to create a new workflow.\n\n## Step three: Add a trigger node[#](#step-three-add-a-trigger-node \"Permanent link\")\n\nA trigger node starts a workflow. For this tutorial, use the [Chat Trigger](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chattrigger/). This provides a chat interface that you can use to test the workflow.\n\n1.  Select **Add first step**.\n2.  Search for **Chat Trigger**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\n3.  Select **Chat Trigger** to add the node to the canvas. n8n opens the node.\n4.  Close the node details view to return to the canvas.\n\n## Step four: Add an agent[#](#step-four-add-an-agent \"Permanent link\")\n\nAn agent takes an input, such as a user query, then uses a collection of tools to respond. In n8n the AI Agent node is a root node: a node whose behavior you can configure using sub-nodes.\n\nCluster nodes: root and sub-nodes\n\nCluster nodes are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a root node and one or more sub-nodes that extend the functionality of the node.\n\n![Screenshot of a workflow with a root node and two sub-nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-sub-nodes.png)\n\n1.  Select the **Add node** ![Add node icon](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/try-it-out/add-node-small.png) connector. n8n opens the nodes panel.\n2.  Search for **Agent**. n8n shows a list of nodes that match the search.\n3.  Select **AI Agent**. n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.\n4.  Close the node details view to return to the canvas.\n\n## Step five: Chat functionality[#](#step-five-chat-functionality \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo provide chat interactions, the workflow needs:\n\n*   A chat model, to process chat inputs and generate responses.\n*   Memory, so that the workflow can remember and use previous sections of the chat.\n\nUse the connectors on the bottom of the AI Agent node to connect the following:\n\n*   **Model**: OpenAI Chat Model. Set up the credentials for this node.\n    \n    Credential setup steps\n    \n    1.  Create an account with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).\n    2.  [Create API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).\n    3.  In the OpenAI Chat Model node, select **Credential to connect with** > **Create New Credential** to open the credential modal.\n    4.  Paste the API key into **API Key**.\n    5.  Select **Save**. n8n tests the connection and confirms if the key is working.\n    6.  Close the credential modal.\n    \n*   **Memory**: Window Buffer Memory\n    \n\n## Step six: Get data from another n8n workflow[#](#step-six-get-data-from-another-n8n-workflow \"Permanent link\")\n\nOne unique feature of AI in n8n is the ability to pull in data from other n8n workflows using the [Custom n8n Workflow Tool node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/). This means you can:\n\n*   Load your own custom data\n*   Create custom functionality in another workflow\n\nBecause n8n can connect to any service with a public API, this is a powerful tool.\n\nThis example generates some fake data in a workflow, and loads it in to the AI workflow. The AI workflow passes a parameter to the workflow generating the data, to ensure it only returns data that's intended to be public.\n\n1.  Create a new workflow, then copy in this workflow JSON:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    | 1<br>  2<br>  3<br>  4<br>  5<br>  6<br>  7<br>  8<br>  9<br> 10<br> 11<br> 12<br> 13<br> 14<br> 15<br> 16<br> 17<br> 18<br> 19<br> 20<br> 21<br> 22<br> 23<br> 24<br> 25<br> 26<br> 27<br> 28<br> 29<br> 30<br> 31<br> 32<br> 33<br> 34<br> 35<br> 36<br> 37<br> 38<br> 39<br> 40<br> 41<br> 42<br> 43<br> 44<br> 45<br> 46<br> 47<br> 48<br> 49<br> 50<br> 51<br> 52<br> 53<br> 54<br> 55<br> 56<br> 57<br> 58<br> 59<br> 60<br> 61<br> 62<br> 63<br> 64<br> 65<br> 66<br> 67<br> 68<br> 69<br> 70<br> 71<br> 72<br> 73<br> 74<br> 75<br> 76<br> 77<br> 78<br> 79<br> 80<br> 81<br> 82<br> 83<br> 84<br> 85<br> 86<br> 87<br> 88<br> 89<br> 90<br> 91<br> 92<br> 93<br> 94<br> 95<br> 96<br> 97<br> 98<br> 99<br>100<br>101 | `{ \t\"name\": \"Workflow tool example\", \t\"nodes\": [ \t\t{ \t\t\"parameters\": { \t\t\t\"jsCode\": \"return [{\\\"fruit\\\": \\\"apple\\\", \\\"color\\\": \\\"green\\\", \\\"dataPrivacyLevel\\\": \\\"public\\\"},{\\\"fruit\\\": \\\"banana\\\", \\\"color\\\": \\\"yellow\\\", \\\"dataPrivacyLevel\\\": \\\"public\\\"},{\\\"fruit\\\": \\\"tomato\\\", \\\"color\\\": \\\"red\\\", \\\"dataPrivacyLevel\\\": \\\"private\\\"}]\" \t\t}, \t\t\"id\": \"4a30b74c-ed27-4668-8e68-c2e3a630ecd9\", \t\t\"name\": \"Code\", \t\t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.code\", \t\t\"typeVersion\": 2, \t\t\"position\": [ \t\t\t1180, \t\t\t500 \t\t] \t\t}, \t\t{ \t\t\"parameters\": { \t\t\t\"conditions\": { \t\t\t\"string\": [ \t\t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\"value1\": \"={{ $json.dataPrivacyLevel }}\", \t\t\t\t\"value2\": \"={{ $('Execute Workflow Trigger').item.json.visibility  }}\" \t\t\t\t} \t\t\t] \t\t\t} \t\t}, \t\t\"id\": \"eb479841-8099-4537-b89b-4b9867446688\", \t\t\"name\": \"Filter\", \t\t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.filter\", \t\t\"typeVersion\": 1, \t\t\"position\": [ \t\t\t1380, \t\t\t500 \t\t] \t\t}, \t\t{ \t\t\"parameters\": { \t\t\t\"aggregate\": \"aggregateAllItemData\", \t\t\t\"include\": \"specifiedFields\", \t\t\t\"fieldsToInclude\": \"fruit, color\", \t\t\t\"options\": {} \t\t}, \t\t\"id\": \"6d6c847d-7417-4780-8a8b-b99996cd6166\", \t\t\"name\": \"Aggregate\", \t\t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.aggregate\", \t\t\"typeVersion\": 1, \t\t\"position\": [ \t\t\t1600, \t\t\t500 \t\t] \t\t}, \t\t{ \t\t\"parameters\": {}, \t\t\"id\": \"1ec54b09-7533-4280-8bf2-54407d6bf134\", \t\t\"name\": \"Execute Workflow Trigger\", \t\t\"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.executeWorkflowTrigger\", \t\t\"typeVersion\": 1, \t\t\"position\": [ \t\t\t1000, \t\t\t500 \t\t] \t\t} \t], \t\"pinData\": {}, \t\"connections\": { \t\t\"Code\": { \t\t\"main\": [ \t\t\t[ \t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\"node\": \"Filter\", \t\t\t\t\"type\": \"main\", \t\t\t\t\"index\": 0 \t\t\t} \t\t\t] \t\t] \t\t}, \t\t\"Filter\": { \t\t\"main\": [ \t\t\t[ \t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\"node\": \"Aggregate\", \t\t\t\t\"type\": \"main\", \t\t\t\t\"index\": 0 \t\t\t} \t\t\t] \t\t] \t\t}, \t\t\"Execute Workflow Trigger\": { \t\t\"main\": [ \t\t\t[ \t\t\t{ \t\t\t\t\"node\": \"Code\", \t\t\t\t\"type\": \"main\", \t\t\t\t\"index\": 0 \t\t\t} \t\t\t] \t\t] \t\t} \t} }` |\n    \n    The workflow uses the Code node to generate a sample data set, containing a list of fruits, their colors, and whether this information should be public or private.\n2.  Copy the workflow ID from workflow URL. The ID is the group of random numbers and letters at the end of the URL.\n3.  In the AI workflow, select the **Tool** output on the **AI Agent**. n8n opens the nodes panel.\n4.  Select **Custom n8n Workflow Tool**. n8n adds the node to the canvas and opens it.\n5.  Configure the node parameters:\n    *   **Name**: `Fruit`\n    *   **Description**: `Call this tool to get a list of fruit.`\n    *   **Workflow ID**: Paste in the workflow ID that you copied from the example workflow URL.\n    *   **Field to Return**: `data`. This is the name of the item created in the Aggregate node in the example workflow.\n6.  Select **Add Value** in **Workflow Values** to pass information to the workflow you're calling. Configure the value as follows:\n    \n    *   **Name**: `visibility`\n    *   **Type**: String\n    *   **Value**: `public`\n    \n    n8n makes this value available to the workflow in the output data of the trigger node in the workflow you're calling. In this example, to access the value in an expression, use `{{ $('Execute Workflow Trigger').item.json.visibility }}`. You can see this in practice in the Filter node in the sample workflow.\n    \n\n## Step seven: Test the workflow[#](#step-seven-test-the-workflow \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can now try out the workflow: close any open nodes, then select **Chat** to start talking with the AI. Ask `Please give me a list of fruits`. The AI Agent node executes the workflow you specified in **Workflow ID**, passing in the value of `visibility` from the **Workflow Values** field. The workflow generates some sample data, filters it to remove any items that aren't set to `public`, and returns the resulting data.\n\n## Next steps[#](#next-steps \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   Explore n8n using the [Quickstarts](https://docs.n8n.io/try-it-out/).\n*   Learn more about AI concepts and view examples in [Examples and concepts](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/introduction/).\n*   Browse AI [Workflow templates](https://n8n.io/workflows/?categories=25).\n*   Read [What product people need to know about LangChain](https://www.commandbar.com/blog/langchain-guide) to learn more about AI concepts and terminology."

These components can include models and memory (though note that in n8n chains can't use memory).\n\n## Chains in n8n[#](#chains-in-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n provides three chain nodes:\n\n*   [Basic LLM Chain](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainllm/): use to interact with an LLM, without any additional components.\n*   [Question and Answer Chain](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainretrievalqa/): can connect to a vector store using a retriever, or to an n8n workflow using the Workflow Retriever node. Use this if you want to create a workflow that supports asking questions about specific documents.\n*   [Summarization Chain](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.chainsummarization/): takes an input and returns a summary.\n\nThere's an important difference between chains in n8n and in other tools such as LangChain: none of the chain nodes support memory. This means they can't remember previous user queries. If you use LangChain to code an AI application, you can give your application memory. In n8n, if you need your workflow to support memory, use an agent. This is essential if you want users to be able to have a natural ongoing conversation with your app."

Where a chain follows a predetermined sequence of calls to different AI components, an agent uses a language model to determine which actions to take.\n\nAgents are the part of AI that act as decision-makers. They can interact with other agents and tools. When you send a query to an agent, it tries to choose the best tools to use to answer. Agents adapt to your specific queries, as well as the prompts that configure their behavior.\n\n## Agents in n8n[#](#agents-in-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n provides one Agent node, which can act as different types of agent depending on the settings you choose. Refer to the [Agent node documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/) for details on the available agent types.\n\nWhen execute a workflow containing an agent, the agent runs multiple times.

([source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/memories/vector-db))\n\nThis enables fast and accurate similarity searches. With a vector database, instead of using conventional database queries, you can search for relevant data based on semantic and contextual meaning.\n\n## A simplified example[#](#a-simplified-example \"Permanent link\")\n\nA vector database could store the sentence \"n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host\", but instead of storing it as text, the vector database stores an array of dimensions (numbers between 0 and 1) that represent its features. This doesn't mean turning each letter in the sentence into a number. Instead, the vectors in the vector database describe the sentence.\n\nSuppose that in a vector store `0.1` represents `automation tool`, `0.2` represents `source available`, and `0.3` represents `can be self-hosted`. You could end up with the following vectors:\n\n| Sentence | Vector (array of dimensions) |\n| --- | --- |\n| n8n is a source-available automation tool that you can self-host | \\[0.1, 0.2, 0.3\\] |\n| Zapier is an automation tool | \\[0.1\\] |\n| Make is an automation tool | \\[0.1\\] |\n| Confluence is a wiki tool that you can self-host | \\[0.3\\] |\n\nThis example is very simplified\n\nIn practice, vectors are far more complex. A vector can range in size from tens to thousands of dimensions. The dimensions don't have a one-to-one relationship to a single feature, so you can't translate individual dimensions directly into single concepts. This example gives an approximate mental model, not a true technical understanding.\n\n## Demonstrating the power of similarity search[#](#demonstrating-the-power-of-similarity-search \"Permanent link\")\n\nQdrant provides [vector search demos](https://qdrant.tech/demo/) to help users understand the power of vector databases. The [food discovery demo](https://food-discovery.qdrant.tech/) shows how a vector store can help match pictures based on visual similarities.\n\n> This demo uses data from Delivery Service. Users may like or dislike the photo of a dish, and the app will recommend more similar meals based on how they look. It's also possible to choose to view results from the restaurants within the delivery radius. ([source](https://qdrant.tech/demo/))\n\nFor full technical details, refer to the [Qdrant demo-food-discovery GitHub repository](https://github.com/qdrant/demo-food-discovery).\n\n## Embeddings, retrievers, text splitters, and document loaders[#](#embeddings-retrievers-text-splitters-and-document-loaders \"Permanent link\")\n\nVector databases require other tools to function:\n\n*   Document loaders and text splitters: document loaders pull in documents and data, and prepare them for embedding. Document loaders can use text splitters to break documents into chunks.\n*   Embeddings: these are the tools that turn the data (text, images, and so on) into vectors, and back into raw data. Note that n8n only supports text embeddings.\n*   Retrievers: retrievers fetch documents from vector databases. You need to pair them with an embedding to translate the vectors back into data."

For full details of how to use JMESPath, refer to the [JMESPath documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html).\n\n## The `jmespath()` method[#](#the-jmespath-method \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n provides a custom method, `jmespath()`. Use this method to perform a search on a JSON object using the JMESPath query language.\n\nThe basic syntax is:\n\nJavaScriptPython\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `$jmespath(object, searchString)` |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `_jmespath(object, searchString)` |\n\nTo help understand what the method does, here is the equivalent longer JavaScript:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `var jmespath = require('jmespath'); jmespath.search(object, searchString);` |\n\nExpressions must be single-line\n\nThe longer code example doesn't work in Expressions, as they must be single-line.\n\n`object` is a JSON object, such as the output of a previous node. `searchString` is an expression written in the JMESPath query language. The [JMESPath Specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#jmespath-specification) provides a list of supported expressions, while their [Tutorial](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html) and [Examples](https://jmespath.org/examples.html) provide interactive examples.\n\nSearch parameter order\n\nThe examples in the [JMESPath Specification](https://jmespath.org/specification.html#jmespath-specification) follow the pattern `search(searchString, object)`. The [JMESPath JavaScript library](https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.js/), which n8n uses, supports `search(object, searchString)` instead. This means that when using examples from the JMESPath documentation, you may need to change the order of the search function parameters.\n\n## Common tasks[#](#common-tasks \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in [JMESPath's own documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html).\n\nWhen trying out these examples, you need to set the Code node **Mode** to **Run Once for Each Item**.\n\n### Apply a JMESPath expression to a collection of elements with projections[#](#apply-a-jmespath-expression-to-a-collection-of-elements-with-projections \"Permanent link\")\n\nFrom the [JMESPath projections documentation](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html#projections):\n\n> Projections are one of the key features of JMESPath. Use it to apply an expression to a collection of elements. JMESPath supports five kinds of projections:\n> \n> *   List Projections\n> *   Slice Projections\n> *   Object Projections\n> *   Flatten Projections\n> *   Filter Projections\n\nThe following example shows basic usage of list, slice, and object projections.

Tools act like addons that your AI can use to access extra context or resources.\n\nHere are a couple of other ways of expressing it:\n\n> Tools are interfaces that an agent can use to interact with the world ([source](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/tool-calling/))\n\n> We can think of these tools as being almost like functions that your AI model can call ([source](https://www.udemy.com/course/chatgpt-and-langchain-the-complete-developers-masterclass/))\n\nn8n provides tool sub-nodes that you can connect to your AI agent. As well as providing some popular tools, such as [Wikipedia](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolwikipedia/) and [SerpAPI](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolserpapi/), n8n provides three especially powerful tools:\n\n*   [Custom n8n Workflow Tool](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/): use this to load any n8n workflow as a tool.\n*   [Custom Code Tool](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolcode/): write code that your agent can run.\n*   [HTTP Request Tool](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest/): make calls to fetch a website or data from an API.\n\nThe next three examples highlight the Custom n8n Workflow Tool:\n\n*   [Chat with Google Sheets](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/data-google-sheets/)\n*   [Call an API to fetch data](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/api-workflow-tool/)\n*   [Set up a human fallback](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/human-fallback/)\n\nYou can also learn how to [let AI dynamically specify parameters for tools with the `$fromAI()` function](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/)."

  "markdown": "# Handling dates | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/cookbook/luxon.md \"Edit this page\")\n\n## Date and time with Luxon[#](#date-and-time-with-luxon \"Permanent link\")\n\n[Luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon/) is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to work with date and time. For full details of how to use Luxon, refer to [Luxon's documentation](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/?id=luxon).\n\nn8n passes dates between nodes as strings, so you need to parse them. Luxon makes this easier.\n\nPython support\n\nLuxon is a JavaScript library. The two convenience [variables](#variables) created by n8n are available when using Python in the Code node, but their functionality is limited:\n\n*   You can't perform Luxon operations on these variables. For example, there is no Python equivalent for `$today.minus(...)`.\n*   The generic Luxon functionality, such as [Convert date string to Luxon](#convert-date-string-to-Luxon), isn't available for Python users.\n\n## Variables[#](#variables \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n uses Luxon to provide two custom variables:\n\n*   `now`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to `DateTime.now()`.\n*   `today`: a Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 })`.\n\nNote that these variables can return different time formats when cast as a string. This is the same behavior as Luxon's `DateTime.now()`.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{{$now}} // n8n displays the ISO formatted timestamp // For example 2022-03-09T14:02:37.065+00:00 {{\"Today's date is \" + $now}} // n8n displays \"Today's date is <unix timestamp>\" // For example \"Today's date is 1646834498755\"` |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `$now // n8n displays <ISO formatted timestamp> // For example 2022-03-09T14:00:25.058+00:00 let rightNow = \"Today's date is \" + $now // n8n displays \"Today's date is <unix timestamp>\" // For example \"Today's date is 1646834498755\"` |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `_now # n8n displays <ISO formatted timestamp> # For example 2022-03-09T14:00:25.058+00:00 rightNow = \"Today's date is \" + str(_now) # n8n displays \"Today's date is <unix timestamp>\" # For example \"Today's date is 1646834498755\"` |\n\nn8n provides built-in convenience functions to support data transformation in expressions for dates. Refer to [Data transformation functions | Dates](https://docs.n8n.io/code/builtin/data-transformation-functions/dates/) for more information.\n\n## Date and time behavior in n8n[#](#date-and-time-behavior-in-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nBe aware of the following:\n\n*   In a workflow, n8n converts dates and times to strings between nodes. Keep this in mind when doing arithmetic on dates and times from other nodes.\n*   With vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with `new Date('2019-06-23')`. In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as `DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23')` or `DateTime.fromFormat(\"23-06-2019\", \"dd-MM-yyyy\")`.\n\n## Setting the timezone in n8n[#](#setting-the-timezone-in-n8n \"Permanent link\")\n\nLuxon uses the n8n timezone. This value is either:\n\n*   Default: `America/New York`\n*   A custom timezone for your n8n instance, set using the `GENERIC_TIMEZONE` environment variable.\n*   A custom timezone for an individual workflow, configured in workflow settings.\n\n## Common tasks[#](#common-tasks \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis section provides examples for some common operations. More examples, and detailed guidance, are available in [Luxon's own documentation](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/?id=luxon).\n\n### Convert date string to Luxon[#](#convert-date-string-to-luxon \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can convert date strings and other date formats to a Luxon DateTime object. You can convert from standard formats and from arbitrary strings.\n\nA difference between Luxon DateTime and JavaScript Date\n\nWith vanilla JavaScript, you can convert a string to a date with `new Date('2019-06-23')`. In Luxon, you must use a function explicitly stating the format, such as `DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23')` or `DateTime.fromFormat(\"23-06-2019\", \"dd-MM-yyyy\")`.\n\n#### If you have a date in a supported standard technical format:[#](#if-you-have-a-date-in-a-supported-standard-technical-format \"Permanent link\")\n\nMost dates use `fromISO()`. This creates a Luxon DateTime from an ISO 8601 string. For example:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23T00:00:00.00')}}` |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `let luxonDateTime = DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23T00:00:00.00')` |\n\nLuxon's API documentation has more information on [fromISO](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimefromiso).\n\nLuxon provides functions to handle conversions for a range of formats. Refer to Luxon's guide to [Parsing technical formats](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=parsing-technical-formats) for details.\n\n#### If you have a date as a string that doesn't use a standard format:[#](#if-you-have-a-date-as-a-string-that-doesnt-use-a-standard-format \"Permanent link\")\n\nUse Luxon's [Ad-hoc parsing](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=ad-hoc-parsing). To do this, use the `fromFormat()` function, providing the string and a set of [tokens](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=table-of-tokens) that describe the format.\n\nFor example, you have n8n's founding date, 23rd June 2019, formatted as `23-06-2019`. You want to turn this into a Luxon object:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{{DateTime.fromFormat(\"23-06-2019\", \"dd-MM-yyyy\")}}` |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `let newFormat = DateTime.fromFormat(\"23-06-2019\", \"dd-MM-yyyy\")` |\n\nWhen using ad-hoc parsing, note Luxon's warning about [Limitations](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=limitations). If you see unexpected results, try their [Debugging](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/parsing?id=debugging) guide.\n\n### Get n days from today[#](#get-n-days-from-today \"Permanent link\")\n\nGet a number of days before or after today.\n\nFor example, you want to set a field to always show the date seven days before the current date.\n\nIn the expressions editor, enter:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{{$today.minus({days: 7})}}` |\n\nOn the 23rd June 2019, this returns `[Object: \"2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00\"]`.\n\nThis example uses n8n's custom variable `$today` for convenience. It's the equivalent of `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7})`.\n\nFor example, you want a variable containing the date seven days before the current date.\n\nIn the code editor, enter:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `let sevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7})` |\n\nOn the 23rd June 2019, this returns `[Object: \"2019-06-16T00:00:00.000+00:00\"]`.\n\nThis example uses n8n's custom variable `$today` for convenience. It's the equivalent of `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 }).minus({days: 7})`.\n\nFor more detailed information and examples, refer to:\n\n*   Luxon's [guide to math](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/math)\n*   Their API documentation on [DateTime plus](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimeplus) and [DateTime minus](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#datetimeminus)\n\n### Create human-readable dates[#](#create-human-readable-dates \"Permanent link\")\n\nIn [Get n days from today](#get-n-days-from-today), the example gets the date seven days before the current date, and returns it as `[Object: \"yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00\"]` (for expressions) or `yyyy-mm-dd-T00:00:00.000+00:00` (in the Code node). To make this more readable, you can use Luxon's formatting functions.\n\nFor example, you want the field containing the date to be formatted as DD/MM/YYYY, so that on the 23rd June 2019, it returns `23/06/2019`.\n\nThis expression gets the date seven days before today, and converts it to the DD/MM/YYYY format.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString()}}` |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `let readableSevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString()` |\n\nYou can alter the format. For example:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{{$today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString({month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'})}}` |\n\nOn 23rd June 2019, this returns \"16 June 2019\".\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `let readableSevenDaysAgo = $today.minus({days: 7}).toLocaleString({month: 'long', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric'})` |\n\nOn 23rd June 2019, this returns \"16 June 2019\".\n\nRefer to Luxon's guide on [toLocaleString (strings for humans)](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/formatting?id=tolocalestring-strings-for-humans) for more information.\n\n### Get the time between two dates[#](#get-the-time-between-two-dates \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo get the time between two dates, use Luxon's diffs feature. This subtracts one date from another and returns a duration.\n\nFor example, get the number of months between two dates:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{{DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()}}` |\n\nThis returns `[Object: {\"months\":1}]`.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `let monthsBetweenDates = DateTime.fromISO('2019-06-23').diff(DateTime.fromISO('2019-05-23'), 'months').toObject()` |\n\nThis returns `{\"months\":1}`.\n\nRefer to Luxon's [Diffs](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/math?id=diffs) for more information.\n\n### A longer example: How many days to Christmas?[#](#a-longer-example-how-many-days-to-christmas \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis example brings together several Luxon features, uses JMESPath, and does some basic string manipulation.\n\nThe scenario: you want a countdown to 25th December. Every day, it should tell you the number of days remaining to Christmas. You don't want to update it for next year - it needs to seamlessly work for every year.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{{\"There are \" + $today.diff(DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days').toObject().days.toString().substring(1) + \" days to Christmas!\"}}` |\n\nThis outputs `\"There are <number of days> days to Christmas!\"`. For example, on 9th March, it outputs \"There are 291 days to Christmas!\".\n\nA detailed explanation of what the expression does:\n\n*   `{{`: indicates the start of the expression.\n*   `\"There are \"`: a string.\n*   `+`: used to join two strings.\n*   `$today.diff()`: This is similar to the example in [Get the time between two dates](#get-the-time-between-two-dates), but it uses n8n's custom `$today` variable.\n*   `DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days'`: this part gets the current year using `$today.year`, turns it into an ISO string along with the month and date, and then takes the whole ISO string and converts it to a Luxon DateTime data structure. It also tells Luxon that you want the duration in days.\n*   `toObject()` turns the result of diff() into a more usable object. At this point, the expression returns `[Object: {\"days\":-<number-of-days>}]`. For example, on 9th March, `[Object: {\"days\":-291}]`.\n*   `.days` uses JMESPath syntax to retrieve just the number of days from the object. For more information on using JMESPath with n8n, refer to our [JMESpath](https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/jmespath/) documentation. This gives you the number of days to Christmas, as a negative number.\n*   `.toString().substring(1)` turns the number into a string and removes the `-`.\n*   `+ \" days to Christmas!\"`: another string, with a `+` to join it to the previous string.\n*   `}}`: indicates the end of the expression.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `let daysToChristmas = \"There are \" + $today.diff(DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days').toObject().days.toString().substring(1) + \" days to Christmas!\";` |\n\nThis outputs `\"There are <number of days> days to Christmas!\"`. For example, on 9th March, it outputs \"There are 291 days to Christmas!\".\n\nA detailed explanation of what the code does:\n\n*   `\"There are \"`: a string.\n*   `+`: used to join two strings.\n*   `$today.diff()`: This is similar to the example in [Get the time between two dates](#get-the-time-between-two-dates), but it uses n8n's custom `$today` variable.\n*   `DateTime.fromISO($today.year + '-12-25'), 'days'`: this part gets the current year using `$today.year`, turns it into an ISO string along with the month and date, and then takes the whole ISO string and converts it to a Luxon DateTime data structure.

At this point, the expression returns `[Object: {\"days\":-<number-of-days>}]`.

The AI model will fill in appropriate data given the context from the task and information from other connected tools.\n\n## How the `$fromAI()` function works[#](#how-the-fromai-function-works \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe `$fromAI()` function uses AI to dynamically fill in parameters for tools connected to the [Tools AI agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent/). You can use the `$fromAI()` function in expressions within [app nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/) (like [Gmail](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.gmail/), [Notion](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.notion/), or [Slack](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.slack/)) connected to a tool node.\n\nTo use the `$fromAI()` function, call it with the required `key` parameter:\n\nThe `key` parameter and other arguments to the `$fromAI()` function aren't references to existing values. Instead, think of these arguments as hints that the AI model will use to populate the right data.\n\nFor instance, if you choose a key called `email`, the AI Model will look for an email address in its context, other tools, and input data. In chat workflows, it may ask the user for an email address if it can't find one elsewhere. You can optionally pass other parameters like `description` to give extra context to the AI model.\n\n## Parameters[#](#parameters \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe `$fromAI()` function accepts the following parameters:\n\n## Examples[#](#examples \"Permanent link\")\n\nAs an example, you could use the following `$fromAI()` expression to dynamically populate a field with a name:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `$fromAI(\"name\", \"The commenter's name\", \"string\", \"Jane Doe\")` |\n\nIf you don't need the optional parameters, you could simplify this as:\n\nTo dynamically populate the number of items you have in stock, you could use a `$fromAI()` expression like this:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `$fromAI(\"numItemsInStock\", \"Number of items in stock\", \"number\", 5)` |\n\n## Templates[#](#templates \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can see the `$fromAI()` function in action in the following templates:\n\n*   [Angie, Personal AI Assistant with Telegram Voice and Text](https://n8n.io/workflows/2462-angie-personal-ai-assistant-with-telegram-voice-and-text/)\n*   [Automate Customer Support Issue Resolution using AI Text Classifier](https://n8n.io/workflows/2468-automate-customer-support-issue-resolution-using-ai-text-classifier/)\n*   [Scale Deal Flow with a Pitch Deck AI Vision, Chatbot and QDrant Vector Store](https://n8n.io/workflows/2464-scale-deal-flow-with-a-pitch-deck-ai-vision-chatbot-and-qdrant-vector-store/)"

The workflow must be active and called by a trigger or webhook to save static data.\n*   This feature may behave unreliably under high-frequency workflow executions.\n\nYou can save data directly in the workflow. This data should be small.\n\nAs an example: you can save a timestamp of the last item processed from an RSS feed or database. It will always return an object. Properties can then read, delete or set on that object. When the workflow execution succeeds, n8n checks automatically if the data has changed and saves it, if necessary.\n\nThere are two types of static data, global and node. Global static data is the same in the whole workflow. Every node in the workflow can access it. The node static data is unique to the node. Only the node that set it can retrieve it again.\n\nExample with global data:\n\nJavaScriptPython\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `// Get the global workflow static data const workflowStaticData = $getWorkflowStaticData('global');  // Access its data const lastExecution = workflowStaticData.lastExecution;  // Update its data workflowStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime();  // Delete data delete workflowStaticData.lastExecution;` |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `# Get the global workflow static data workflowStaticData = _getWorkflowStaticData('global')  # Access its data lastExecution = workflowStaticData.lastExecution  # Update its data workflowStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime()  # Delete data delete workflowStaticData.lastExecution` |\n\nExample with node data:\n\nJavaScriptPython\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `// Get the static data of the node const nodeStaticData = $getWorkflowStaticData('node');  // Access its data const lastExecution = nodeStaticData.lastExecution;  // Update its data nodeStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime();  // Delete data delete nodeStaticData.lastExecution;` |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `# Get the static data of the node nodeStaticData = _getWorkflowStaticData('node')  # Access its data lastExecution = nodeStaticData.lastExecution  # Update its data nodeStaticData.lastExecution = new Date().getTime()  # Delete data delete nodeStaticData.lastExecution` |\n\n## Templates and examples[#](#templates-and-examples \"Permanent link\")"

  "markdown": "# Using the API playground | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/api/using-api-playground.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nFeature availability\n\nThe API playground isn't available on Cloud. It's available for all self-hosted pricing tiers.\n\nThe n8n API comes with a built-in Swagger UI playground in self-hosted versions. This provides interactive documentation, where you can try out requests. The path to access the playground depends on your hosting.\n\nn8n constructs the path from values set in your environment variables:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `N8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/docs` |\n\nThe API version number is `1`. There may be multiple versions available in the future.\n\nReal data\n\nIf you select **Authorize** and enter your API key in the API playground, you have access to your live data. This is useful for trying out requests. Be aware you can change or delete real data.\n\nThe API includes built-in documentation about credential formats. This is available using the `credentials` endpoint:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `N8N_HOST:N8N_PORT/N8N_PATH/api/v<api-version-number>/credentials/schema/{credentialTypeName}` |\n\nHow to find `credentialTypeName`\n\nTo find the type, download your workflow as JSON and examine it. For example, for a Google Drive node the `{credentialTypeName}` is `googleDriveOAuth2Api`:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{     ...,     \"credentials\": {         \"googleDriveOAuth2Api\": {         \"id\": \"9\",         \"name\": \"Google Drive\"         }     } }` |"

  "markdown": "# Retrieve linked items from earlier in the workflow\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/code/cookbook/builtin/itemmatching.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nEvery item in a node's input data links back to the items used in previous nodes to generate it. This is useful if you need to retrieve linked items from further back than the immediate previous node.\n\nTo access the linked items from earlier in the workflow, use `(\"<node-name>\").itemMatching(currentNodeinputIndex)`.\n\nFor example, consider a workflow that does the following:\n\n1.  The Customer Datastore node generates example data:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    | 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19 | `[ \t{ \t\t\"id\": \"23423532\", \t\t\"name\": \"Jay Gatsby\", \t\t\"email\": \"gatsby@west-egg.com\", \t\t\"notes\": \"Keeps asking about a green light??\", \t\t\"country\": \"US\", \t\t\"created\": \"1925-04-10\" \t}, \t{ \t\t\"id\": \"23423533\", \t\t\"name\": \"José Arcadio Buendía\", \t\t\"email\": \"jab@macondo.co\", \t\t\"notes\": \"Lots of people named after him. Very confusing\", \t\t\"country\": \"CO\", \t\t\"created\": \"1967-05-05\" \t}, \t... ]` |\n    \n2.  The Edit Fields node simplifies this data:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `[ \t{ \t\t\"name\": \"Jay Gatsby\" \t}, \t{ \t\t\"name\": \"José Arcadio Buendía\" \t},     ... ]` |\n    \n3.  The Code node restore the email address to the correct person:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `[ \t{ \t\t\"name\": \"Jay Gatsby\", \t\t\"restoreEmail\": \"gatsby@west-egg.com\" \t}, \t{ \t\t\"name\": \"José Arcadio Buendía\", \t\t\"restoreEmail\": \"jab@macondo.co\" \t}, \t... ]` |\n    \n\nThe Code node does this using the following code:\n\nJavaScriptPython\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `for(let i=0; i<$input.all().length; i++) { \t$input.all()[i].json.restoreEmail = $('Customer Datastore (n8n training)').itemMatching(i).json.email; } return $input.all();` |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `for i,item in enumerate(_input.all()): \t_input.all()[i].json.restoreEmail = _('Customer Datastore (n8n training)').itemMatching(i).json.email  return _input.all();` |\n\nYou can view and download the example workflow from [n8n website | itemMatchin usage example](https://n8n.io/workflows/1966-itemmatching-usage-example/) ."

  "markdown": "# Prerequisites | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/embed/prerequisites.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nFeature availability\n\nEmbed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.\n\nThe requirements provided here are an example based on n8n Cloud and are for illustrative purposes only. Your requirements may vary depending on the number of users, workflows, and executions. Contact n8n for more information.\n\n| Component | Sizing | Supported |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| CPU/vCPU | Minimum 10 CPU cycles, scaling as needed | Any public or private cloud |\n| Database | 512 MB - 4 GB SSD | SQLite or PostgreSQL |\n| Memory | 320 MB - 2 GB |     |\n\n## CPU considerations[#](#cpu-considerations \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n isn't CPU intensive so even small instances (of providers such as AWS and GCP) should be enough for most use cases. Usually, memory requirements supersede CPU requirements, so focus resources there when planning your infrastructure.\n\n## Database considerations[#](#database-considerations \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n uses its database to store credentials, past executions, and workflows.\n\nA core feature of n8n is the flexibility to choose a database. All the supported databases have different advantages and disadvantages, which you have to consider individually and pick the one that best suits your needs. By default n8n creates an SQLite database if no database exists at the given location.\n\nn8n recommends that every n8n instance have a dedicated database. This helps to prevent dependencies and potential performance degradation. If it isn't possible to provide a dedicated database for every n8n instance, n8n recommends making use of Postgres's schema feature.\n\nFor Postgres, the database must already exist on the DB-instance. The database user for the n8n process needs to have full permissions on all tables that they're using or creating. n8n creates and maintains the database schema.\n\n### Best practices[#](#best-practices \"Permanent link\")\n\n*   SSD storage.\n*   In containerized cloud environments, ensure that the volume is persisted and mounted when stopping/starting a container. If not, all data is lost.\n*   If using Postgres, don't use the `tablePrefix` configuration option. It will be deprecated in the near future.\n*   Pay attention to the changelog of new versions and consider reverting migrations before downgrading.\n*   Set up at least the basic database security and stability mechanisms such as IP allow lists and backups.\n\n## Memory considerations[#](#memory-considerations \"Permanent link\")\n\nAn n8n instance doesn't typically require large amounts of available memory. For example an n8n Cloud instance at idle requires ~100MB. It's the nature of your workflows and the data being processed that determines your memory requirements.\n\nFor example, while most nodes just pass data to the next node in the workflow, the [Code node](https://docs.n8n.io/code/code-node/) creates a pre-processing and post-processing copy of the data. When dealing will large binary files, this can consume all available resources."

  "markdown": "# Deployment | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/embed/deployment.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nFeature availability\n\nEmbed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.\n\nSee the [hosting documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/server-setup.html) for detailed setup options.\n\n## User data[#](#user-data \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n recommends that you follow the same or similar practices used internally for n8n Cloud: Save user data using [Rook](https://rook.io/) and, if an n8n server goes down, a new instance starts on another machine using the same data.\n\nDue to this, you don't need to use backups except in case of a catastrophic failure, or when a user wants to reactivate their account within your prescribed retention period (two weeks for n8n Cloud).\n\n## Backups[#](#backups \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n recommends creating nightly backups by attaching another container, and copying all data to this second container. In this manner, RAM usage is negligible, and so doesn't impact the amount of users you can place on the server.\n\n## Restarting[#](#restarting \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf your instance is down or restarting, missed executions (for example, Cron or Webhook nodes) during this time aren't recoverable. If it's important for you to maintain 100% uptime, you need to build another proxy in front of it which caches the data."

  "markdown": "# Workflow management | n8n Docs\n\nWhen managing an embedded n8n deployment, spanning across teams or organizations, you will likely need to run the same (or similar) workflows for multiple users. There are two available options for doing so:\n\nHere you need to capture all credentials for any node/service this user must authenticate with, along with any additional parameters required for the particular workflow. The credentials and any parameters needed will depend on your workflow and what you are trying to do.\n\nAfter all relevant credential details have been obtained, you can proceed to create the relevant service credentials in n8n. This can be done using the Editor UI or API call.\n\nThe frontend API used by the Editor UI can also be called to achieve the same result. The API endpoint is in the format: `https://<n8n-domain>/rest/credentials`.\n\nFor example, to create the credentials in the Editor UI example above, the request would be:\n\nThe response will contain the ID of the new credentials, which you will use when creating the workflow for this user:\n\nBest practice is to have a “base” workflow that you then duplicate and customize for each new user with their credentials (and any other details).\n\nYou can duplicate and customize your template workflow using either the Editor UI or API call.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br>  2<br>  3<br>  4<br>  5<br>  6<br>  7<br>  8<br>  9<br> 10<br> 11<br> 12<br> 13<br> 14<br> 15<br> 16<br> 17<br> 18<br> 19<br> 20<br> 21<br> 22<br> 23<br> 24<br> 25<br> 26<br> 27<br> 28<br> 29<br> 30<br> 31<br> 32<br> 33<br> 34<br> 35<br> 36<br> 37<br> 38<br> 39<br> 40<br> 41<br> 42<br> 43<br> 44<br> 45<br> 46<br> 47<br> 48<br> 49<br> 50<br> 51<br> 52<br> 53<br> 54<br> 55<br> 56<br> 57<br> 58<br> 59<br> 60<br> 61<br> 62<br> 63<br> 64<br> 65<br> 66<br> 67<br> 68<br> 69<br> 70<br> 71<br> 72<br> 73<br> 74<br> 75<br> 76<br> 77<br> 78<br> 79<br> 80<br> 81<br> 82<br> 83<br> 84<br> 85<br> 86<br> 87<br> 88<br> 89<br> 90<br> 91<br> 92<br> 93<br> 94<br> 95<br> 96<br> 97<br> 98<br> 99<br>100<br>101<br>102<br>103<br>104<br>105<br>106<br>107<br>108<br>109<br>110<br>111<br>112<br>113<br>114<br>115<br>116<br>117<br>118<br>119<br>120<br>121<br>122<br>123<br>124<br>125<br>126<br>127<br>128<br>129<br>130<br>131<br>132<br>133<br>134<br>135<br>136<br>137<br>138<br>139<br>140<br>141<br>142<br>143<br>144<br>145<br>146<br>147<br>148<br>149<br>150<br>151<br>152<br>153<br>154<br>155<br>156<br>157<br>158<br>159<br>160<br>161<br>162<br>163<br>164<br>165<br>166<br>167<br>168<br>169<br>170<br>171<br>172<br>173<br>174<br>175<br>176<br>177<br>178<br>179<br>180<br>181<br>182<br>183<br>184<br>185<br>186<br>187<br>188<br>189<br>190<br>191<br>192<br>193<br>194<br>195<br>196<br>197<br>198<br>199<br>200<br>201<br>202<br>203<br>204<br>205<br>206<br>207<br>208<br>209<br>210<br>211<br>212<br>213<br>214<br>215<br>216<br>217<br>218<br>219<br>220<br>221<br>222<br>223<br>224<br>225<br>226<br>227<br>228 | `{   \"data\": {     \"id\": \"1012\",     \"name\": \"Nathan's Workflow\",     \"active\": false,     \"nodes\": [       {         \"parameters\": {},         \"name\": \"Start\",         \"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.start\",         \"typeVersion\": 1,         \"position\": [           130,           640         ]       },       {         \"parameters\": {           \"authentication\": \"headerAuth\",           \"url\": \"https://internal.users.n8n.cloud/webhook/custom-erp\",           \"options\": {             \"splitIntoItems\": true           },           \"headerParametersUi\": {             \"parameter\": [               {                 \"name\": \"unique_id\",                 \"value\": \"recLhLYQbzNSFtHNq\"               }             ]           }         },         \"name\": \"HTTP Request\",         \"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.httpRequest\",         \"typeVersion\": 1,         \"position\": [           430,           300         ],         \"credentials\": {           \"httpHeaderAuth\": \"beginner_course\"         }       },       {         \"parameters\": {           \"operation\": \"append\",           \"application\": \"appKBGQfbm6NfW6bv\",           \"table\": \"processingOrders\",           \"options\": {}         },         \"name\": \"Airtable\",         \"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.airtable\",         \"typeVersion\": 1,         \"position\": [           990,           210         ],         \"credentials\": {           \"airtableApi\": \"Airtable\"         }       },       {         \"parameters\": {           \"conditions\": {             \"string\": [               {                 \"value1\": \"={{$json[\\\"orderStatus\\\"]}}\",                 \"value2\": \"processing\"               }             ]           }         },         \"name\": \"IF\",         \"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.if\",         \"typeVersion\": 1,         \"position\": [           630,           300         ]       },       {         \"parameters\": {           \"keepOnlySet\": true,           \"values\": {             \"number\": [               {                 \"name\": \"=orderId\",                 \"value\": \"={{$json[\\\"orderID\\\"]}}\"               }             ],             \"string\": [               {                 \"name\": \"employeeName\",                 \"value\": \"={{$json[\\\"employeeName\\\"]}}\"               }             ]           },           \"options\": {}         },         \"name\": \"Set\",         \"type\": \"n8n-nodes-base.set\",         \"typeVersion\": 1,         \"position\": [           800,           210         ]       },       {         \"parameters\": {           \"functionCode\": \"let totalBooked = items.length;\\nlet bookedSum = 0;\\n\\nfor(let i=0;

  "markdown": "# n8n Embed Configuration | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/embed/configuration.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nFeature availability\n\nEmbed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.\n\n## Authentication[#](#authentication \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can secure n8n by setting up [User management](https://docs.n8n.io/user-management/), n8n's built-in authentication feature.\n\nn8n supports [LDAP](https://docs.n8n.io/user-management/ldap/) and [SAML](https://docs.n8n.io/user-management/saml/).\n\n### Credential overwrites[#](#credential-overwrites \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo offer OAuth login to users, it's possible to overwrite credentials on a global basis. This credential data isn't visible to users but the backend uses it automatically.\n\nIn the Editor UI, n8n hides all overwritten fields by default. This means that users are able to authenticate using OAuth by pressing the \"connect\" button on the credentials.\n\nn8n offers two ways to apply credential overwrites: using Environment Variable and using the REST API.\n\n#### Using environment variables[#](#using-environment-variables \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can set credential overwrites using environment variable by setting the `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_DATA` to `{ CREDENTIAL_NAME: { PARAMETER: VALUE }}`.\n\nWarning\n\nEven though this is possible, it isn't recommended. Environment variables aren't protected in n8n, so the data can leak to users.\n\n#### Using REST APIs[#](#using-rest-apis \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe recommended way is to load the data using a custom REST endpoint. Set the `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT` to a path under which this endpoint should be made available.\n\nNote\n\nThe endpoints can be called just one at a time for security reasons.\n\nFor example:\n\n1.  Activate the endpoint by setting the environment variable in the environment n8n runs under:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `export CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT=send-credentials` |\n    \n2.  A JSON file with the credentials to overwrite is then needed. For example, a `oauth-credentials.json` file to overwrite credentials for Asana and GitHub could look like this:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `{     \"asanaOAuth2Api\": {         \"clientId\": \"<id>\",         \"clientSecret\": \"<secret>\"     },     \"githubOAuth2Api\": {         \"clientId\": \"<id>\",         \"clientSecret\": \"<secret>\"     } }` |\n    \n3.  Then apply it to the instance by sending it using curl:\n    \n    |     |     |\n    | --- | --- |\n    |     | `curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data @oauth-credentials.json http://localhost:5678/send-credentials` |\n    \n\nNote\n\nThere are cases when credentials are based on others. For example, the `googleSheetsOAuth2Api` extends the `googleOAuth2Api`. In this case, you can set parameters on the parent credentials (`googleOAuth2Api`) for all child-credentials (`googleSheetsOAuth2Api`) to use.\n\n## Environment variables[#](#environment-variables \"Permanent link\")\n\nn8n has many [environment variables](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/environment-variables/) you can configure. Here are the most relevant environment variables for your hosted solution:\n\n## Backend hooks[#](#backend-hooks \"Permanent link\")\n\nIt's possible to define external hooks that n8n executes whenever a specific operation runs. You can use these, for example, to log data, change data, or forbid an action by throwing an error.\n\n### Available hooks[#](#available-hooks \"Permanent link\")\n\n### Registering hooks[#](#registering-hooks \"Permanent link\")\n\nSet hooks by registering a hook file that contains the hook functions. To register a hook, set the environment variable `EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES`.\n\nYou can set the variable to a single file:\n\n`EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES=/data/hook.js`\n\nOr to contain multiple files separated by a semicolon:\n\n`EXTERNAL_HOOK_FILES=/data/hook1.js;/data/hook2.js`\n\n### Backend hook files[#](#backend-hook-files \"Permanent link\")\n\nHook files are regular JavaScript files that have the following format:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23 | `module.exports = {     \"frontend\": {         \"settings\": [             async function (settings) {                 settings.oauthCallbackUrls.oauth1 = 'https://n8n.example.com/oauth1/callback';                 settings.oauthCallbackUrls.oauth2 = 'https://n8n.example.com/oauth2/callback';             }         ]     },     \"workflow\": {         \"activate\": [             async function (workflowData) {                 const activeWorkflows = await this.dbCollections.Workflow.count({ active: true });                  if (activeWorkflows > 1) {                     throw new Error(                         'Active workflow limit reached.'                     );                 }             }         ]     } }` |\n\n### Backend hook functions[#](#backend-hook-functions \"Permanent link\")\n\nA hook or a hook file can contain multiple hook functions, with all functions executed one after another.\n\nIf the parameters of the hook function are objects, it's possible to change the data of that parameter to change the behavior of n8n.\n\nYou can also access the database in any hook function using `this.dbCollections` (refer to the code sample in [Backend hook files](#backend-hook-files).\n\n## Frontend external hooks[#](#frontend-external-hooks \"Permanent link\")\n\nLike backend external hooks, it's possible to define external hooks in the frontend code that get executed by n8n whenever a user performs a specific operation. You can use them, for example, to log data and change data.\n\n### Available hooks[#](#available-hooks_1 \"Permanent link\")\n\n### Registering hooks[#](#registering-hooks_1 \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can set hooks by loading the hooks script on the page. One way to do this is by creating a hooks file in the project and adding a script tag in your `editor-ui/public/index.html` file:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `<script src=\"frontend-hooks.js\"></script>` |\n\n### Frontend hook files[#](#frontend-hook-files \"Permanent link\")\n\nFrontend external hook files are regular JavaScript files which have the following format:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22 | `window.n8nExternalHooks = {   nodeView: {     mount: [       function (store, meta) {         // do something       },     ],     createNodeActiveChanged: [       function (store, meta) {         // do something       },       function (store, meta) {         // do something else       },     ],     addNodeButton: [       function (store, meta) {         // do something       },     ],   }, };` |\n\n### Frontend hook functions[#](#frontend-hook-functions \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou can define multiple hook functions per hook. Each hook function is invoked with the following arguments arguments:\n\n*   `store`: The Vuex store object. You can use this to change or get data from the store.\n*   `metadata`: The object that contains any data provided by the hook. To see what's passed, search for the hook in the `editor-ui` package."

  "markdown": "# White labelling | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/embed/white-labelling.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nFeature availability\n\nEmbed requires an embed license. For more information about when to use Embed, as well as costs and licensing processes, refer to [Embed](https://n8n.io/embed/) on the n8n website.\n\nWhite labelling n8n means customizing the frontend styling and assets to match your brand identity. The process involves changing two packages in n8n's source code [github.com/n8n-io/n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n):\n\n*   [packages/design-system](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/design-system): n8n's [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) design system with CSS styles and Vue.js components\n*   [packages/editor-ui](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/editor-ui): n8n's [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) frontend build with [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)\n\n## Prerequisites[#](#prerequisites \"Permanent link\")\n\nYou need the following installed on your development machine:\n\n*   [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n*   Node.js and npm. Minimum version Node 18.17.0. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).\n\nCreate a fork of [n8n's repository](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) and clone your new repository.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `git clone https://github.com/<your-organization>/n8n.git n8n cd n8n` |\n\nInstall all dependencies, build and start n8n.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `npm install npm run build npm run start` |\n\nWhenever you make changes you need to rebuild and restart n8n. While developing you can use `npm run dev` to automatically rebuild and restart n8n anytime you make code changes.\n\n## Theme colors[#](#theme-colors \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo customize theme colors open [packages/design-system](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/design-system) and start with:\n\n*   [packages/design-system/src/css/\\_tokens.scss](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/design-system/src/css/_tokens.scss)\n*   [packages/design-system/src/css/\\_tokens.dark.scss](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/design-system/src/css/_tokens.dark.scss)\n\nAt the top of `_tokens.scss` you will find `--color-primary` variables as HSL colors:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `@mixin theme { \t--color-primary-h: 6.9; \t--color-primary-s: 100%; \t--color-primary-l: 67.6%;` |\n\nIn the following example the primary color changes to #0099ff. To convert to HSL you can use a [color converter tool](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp).\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `@mixin theme { \t--color-primary-h: 204; \t--color-primary-s: 100%; \t--color-primary-l: 50%;` |\n\n![Example Theme Color Customization](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/embed/white-label/color-transition.gif)\n\n## Theme logos[#](#theme-logos \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo change the editor’s logo assets look into [packages/editor-ui/public](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/tree/master/packages/editor-ui/public) and replace:\n\n*   favicon-16x16.png\n*   favicon-32x32.png\n*   favicon.ico\n*   n8n-logo.svg\n*   n8n-logo-collapsed.svg\n*   n8n-logo-expanded.svg\n\nReplace these logo assets. n8n uses them in Vue.js components, including:\n\n*   [MainSidebar.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/MainSidebar.vue): top/left logo in the main sidebar.\n*   [Logo.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/Logo.vue): reused in other components.\n\nIn the following example replace `n8n-logo-collapsed.svg` and `n8n-logo-expanded.svg` to update the main sidebar's logo assets.\n\n![Example Logo Main Sidebar](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/embed/white-label/logo-main-sidebar.png)\n\nIf your logo assets require different sizing or placement you can customize SCSS styles at the bottom of [MainSidebar.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/MainSidebar.vue).\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br> 2<br> 3<br> 4<br> 5<br> 6<br> 7<br> 8<br> 9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22 | `.logoItem { \tdisplay: flex; \tjustify-content: space-between; \theight: $header-height; \tline-height: $header-height; \tmargin: 0 !important; \tborder-radius: 0 !important; \tborder-bottom: var(--border-width-base) var(--border-style-base) var(--color-background-xlight); \tcursor: default;  \t&:hover, &:global(.is-active):hover { \t\tbackground-color: initial !important; \t}  \t* { vertical-align: middle; } \t.icon { \t\theight: 18px; \t\tposition: relative; \t\tleft: 6px; \t}  }` |\n\n## Text localization[#](#text-localization \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo change all text occurrences like `n8n` or `n8n.io` to your brand identity you can customize n8n's English internationalization file: [packages/editor-ui/src/plugins/i18n/locales/en.json](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/plugins/i18n/locales/en.json).\n\nn8n uses the [Vue I18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/) internationalization plugin for Vue.js to translate the majority of UI texts. To search and replace text occurrences inside `en.json` you can use [Linked locale messages](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/guide/messages.html#linked-locale-messages).\n\nIn the following example add the `_brand.name` translation key to white label n8n's [AboutModal.vue](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/AboutModal.vue).\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `{ \t\"_brand.name\": \"My Brand\", \t//replace n8n with link to _brand.name \t\"about.aboutN8n\": \"About @:_brand.name\", \t\"about.n8nVersion\": \"@:_brand.name Version\", }` |\n\n![Example About Modal Localization](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/embed/white-label/about-modal.png)\n\n### Window title[#](#window-title \"Permanent link\")\n\nTo change n8n's window title to your brand name, edit the following:\n\n*   [packages/editor-ui/index.html](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/index.html)\n*   [packages/editor-ui/src/components/mixins/titleChange.ts](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/editor-ui/src/components/mixins/titleChange.ts)\n\nThe following example replaces all occurrences of `n8n` and `n8n.io` with `My Brand` in `index.html` and `titleChange.ts`.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | `<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> \t<!-- Replace html title attribute --> \t<title>My Brand - Workflow Automation</title> </head>` |\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | ``$titleSet(workflow: string, status: WorkflowTitleStatus) { \t// replace n8n prefix \twindow.document.title = `My Brand - ${icon} ${workflow}`; },  $titleReset() { \t// replace n8n prefix \tdocument.title = `My Brand - Workflow Automation`; },`` |\n\n![Example Window Title Localization](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/embed/white-label/window-title.png)"

  "markdown": "# Item Lists | n8n Docs\n\n[](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/edit/main/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.itemlists.md \"Edit this page\")\n\nRemoved in 1.21.0\n\nn8n removed the Item Lists node in version 1.21.0. Use the following nodes instead:\n\n*   [Aggregate](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.\n*   [Limit](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.aggregate/): remove items beyond a defined maximum number.\n*   [Remove Duplicates](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/): identify items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.\n*   [Sort](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.sort/): organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.\n*   [Split Out](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.splitout/): separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items.\n*   [Summarize](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.summarize/): aggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.\n\nThe Item Lists node simplifies working with returned data that contain lists (arrays), enabling you to change the structure for further processing without the need to use [Code](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.code/) nodes or write custom JavaScript.\n\n## Operations[#](#operations \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Item Lists node enables you to perform the following operations:\n\n*   Concatenate Items: merge multiple items into a single new item.\n*   Limit: remove items beyond a defined maximum number.\n*   Remove Duplicates: remove extraneous items.\n*   Sort: change the ordering of items.\n*   Split Out Items: create separate items from a list of data within an item.\n*   Summarize: aggregate items together. Similar to a pivot table.\n\n### Split Out Items[#](#split-out-items \"Permanent link\")\n\nThis operation is useful if your data contains a list of items, for example a list of customers, and you want to split them so that you have an item for each customer.\n\nWhen using the Split Out Items operation, configure the following parameters and options:\n\n*   **Field to Split Out**: the field containing the list you want to separate out into individual items.\n    *   If working with file inputs, use `$binary` in an expression to set the field to split out.\n*   **Include**: select if you want n8n to keep any other fields from the input data with each new individual item. You can select:\n    *   **No Other Fields**\n    *   **All Other Fields**\n    *   **Selected Other Fields**: when selected, n8n displays **Fields to Include**. Enter a comma separated list of desired fields.\n    *   **Options** > **Add Field**: use this to add more optional settings, including:\n        *   **Disable Dot Notation**: when disabled, you can't reference child fields (in the format `parent.child`).\n        *   **Destination Field Name**: optionally set the field name under which to put the new split contents.\n        *   **Include Binary**: include binary data (files) from the input in the new output.\n\n### Concatenate Items[#](#concatenate-items \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Concatenate Items operations is useful when you want to take separate items, or portions of them, and group them together into individual items.\n\nWhen using the Concatenate Items operation, configure the following parameters and options:\n\n*   **Aggregate**: choose whether to aggregate **Individual Fields** or **All Item Data**.\n*   If you choose **Individual Fields**, you can then set:\n    *   **Field To Aggregate**: the name of the field in the input data to be aggregated together.\n    *   **Rename Field**: enable this toggle to enter a field name for the aggregated output data. When aggregating multiple fields you must provide new output field names. You can't leave multiple fields undefined.\n    *   **Output Field Name**: displayed when you enable **Rename Field**. The field name for the aggregated output data.\n    *   **Options** > **Add Field**: use this to add more optional settings, including:\n        *   **Disable Dot Notation**: when disabled, you can't reference child fields (in the format `parent.child`).\n        *   **Include Binaries**: include binary data (files) from the input in the new output.\n*   If you choose **All Item Data**, you can then set:\n    *   **Put Output in Field**: the name of the output field.\n    *   **Include**: choose from **All fields**, **Specified Fields**, or **All Fields Except**.\n\n### Remove Duplicates[#](#remove-duplicates \"Permanent link\")\n\nThere are situations where you can end up with duplicate data, such as a user creating multiple accounts, or a customer submitting the same order multiple times. When working with large datasets it becomes more difficult to spot and remove these items.\n\nThe Remove Duplicates operation allows you to identify those items that are identical across all fields or a subset of fields.\n\nWhen using the Remove Duplicates operation, configure the following parameters and options:\n\n*   **Compare**: specify which fields of the input data n8n should compare to check if they're the same. The following options are available:\n*   **All Fields**: compares all fields of the input data.\n*   **All Fields Except**: enter which input data fields n8n should exclude from the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.\n*   **Selected Fields**: enter which input data fields n8n should include in the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.\n*   If you choose **All Fields Except** or **Selected Fields**, n8n displays **Options** > **Add Field**. Use this to add more optional settings, including:\n    *   **Disable Dot Notation**: when disabled, you can't reference child fields (in the format `parent.child`).\n\n### Sort[#](#sort \"Permanent link\")\n\nThe Sort operation allows you to organize lists of in a desired ordering, or generate a random selection.\n\nArray sort behavior\n\nThe Sort operation uses the default JavaScript operation where the elements to be sorted are converted into strings and their values compared. Refer to [Mozilla's guide to Array sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) to learn more.\n\nWhen using the Sort operation, configure the following parameters and options:\n\n*   **Type**: use the dropdown to select how you want to input the sorting. The following options are available:\n*   **Simple**: when you selected, you can use the **Add Field To Sort By** button to input the fields, and select whether to use **Ascending** or **Descending** order.\n*   **Random**: select to create a random order in the list.\n*   **Code**: when selected, displays a code input field where you can enter custom JavaScript code to perform the sort operation.\n*   **Options** > **Add Field**: use this to add more optional settings, including:\n    *   **Disable Dot Notation**: when disabled, you can't reference child fields (in the format `parent.child`).\n\n### Limit[#](#limit \"Permanent link\")\n\nIf you want to keep and process a specific number of items from your incoming data, the Limit operation allows you to select the number of items to keep and whether n8n should take them from the beginning or end of the data.\n\nWhen using the Limit operation, configure the following parameters and options:\n\n*   **Max Items**: enter the maximum number of items that n8n should keep. If the input data contains more than this value, n8n removes the items.\n*   **Keep**: when items must be removed, select if n8n keeps the input items at the beginning or end.\n\n### Summarize[#](#summarize \"Permanent link\")\n\nAggregate items together, in a manner similar to Excel pivot tables.\n\nWhen using the Summarize operation, configure the following parameters and options:\n\n*   **Fields to Summarize**:\n    *   To combine values, select an **Aggregation** method, and enter a **Field** name.\n    *   To split values, enter a field name or list of names in **Fields to Split By**.\n*   **Options** > **Add Field**: use this to add more optional settings, including:\n    *   **Disable Dot Notation**: when disabled, you can't reference child fields (in the format `parent.child`).\n    *   **Each Split in a Separate Item**: splitting generates a separate output item for each split out field.\n    *   **All Splits in a Single Item**: splitting generates a single item, which lists the split out fields.\n\n## Templates and examples[#](#templates-and-examples \"Permanent link\")"
